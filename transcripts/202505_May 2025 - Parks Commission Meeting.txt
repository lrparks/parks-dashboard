Okay. Okay.
um in your um in your packet that um
Mthogy sent uh last week, it has the uh
reports for the staff. So it has of
course your meeting minutes. It has the
volunteer, it has the admin, um it has
operations, it has safety as well. It
also has
um recreation as well. So um are there
any questions? I don't or any of the
Well, any just general comments or
questions? Uh I don't think Leland is
on. I don't think any of the other
deputy directors are on. Um, but any
comments uh or questions that maybe some
of the staff here can answer? If not,
I'm sure we can get answered. But,
[Music]
uh, has everybody lifted
their packet? Any questions,
comments? You know, Leland, I think, is
uh not present. you know, he usually
provides information for what he's
planning to go before the board
director. Huh? I'm going to do that. Oh,
okay. Go ahead. Okay.
Um, hello. How's everyone today? I'm
Karen Sykes, as you know, volunteering
coordinator. So, I'm stepping in for
Leland today. And we do have a few
things to announce. If you weren't
familiar, um, if you didn't attend the
board meeting last night, we had three
items on the consent agenda that they
will vote on next Tuesday at 6:00
p.m. And one of those things is new
maintenance equipment for our golf
courses that come to aboutund or
$350,000. We have 10 to 20 year old
equipment that really needs to be
replaced, so this is a good thing. We
also want to replace our space net at
Riverfront Park and that's going to come
in at about $110,000.
Space net. It was um it's a net like a
triangle or Christmas tree.
Where is that? River Park. Okay. There
was one there and it was deemed unsafe.
So, it's been removed and now we're
ready to replace it. Okay. And then
something that's I think is really
exciting is we're they're going to vote
on a
$4.1 million renovation and expansion on
the center at University Park, you know,
which is where we usually
meet. And they're going to turn that
into a senior center. It will have a
therapy pool, a pickle ball court, some
showers. So, those three items will be
on uh will be up for vote next Tuesday
at 6. Is that bond money that the 4.1
million?
No, that
um we can find out. Uh also, as a
reminder, uh we have the
uh fundraiser for Reservoir Park next
Wednesday.
from 5 to 7 at Trios. So, we hope to see
y'all there. Come on out and support.
That money is to go to playground and
this golf
course. Speaking of reservoir, um couple
of Saturdays ago, 20 volunteers planted
81gallon oak trees in that
hard hard
dirt. They did a great job. That was for
Impact the Rock. Um they there's lots of
moaning but man they worked hard. I'm
really proud of them. We also have our
summer
playground that registration is open and
it's open until it's full. There are six
locations at Dunar Stevens Chico Roma
West Central and East Little Rock. And
that is from June 2nd to July 24th. It's
a $100 a child. um operations has pretty
much been working on storm debris
removal for the last month. Um park
staff from recreation administration,
volunteers, and communications attended
the city's uh mobile city hall in Ward
3. We had a great
time. We also have finished the Kowanas
Park renovations and we had the ribbon
cutting a couple of weeks ago. The mayor
attended. It's a new playground. Uh
updates on the pavilion. I mean, it's
it's the best it's ever looked and I've
been here for 10 years. So, it it's
really nice over there. Please go by and
check it out. Hey, and then
it would be great at any of
the park openings if we could know. I
know that they're they recently shuffled
I forget the gentleman's name now that's
doing the marketing, but we used to
get like an email a week or two out on
those so that we could attend if we're,
you know, available.
Am I allowed to speak? Yeah, canon. I
can start sending emails. Leland did
announce it at the commission meeting um
beforehand, but I'll I'll I'll send you
all emails in the future. Yeah, I
appreciate it. I mean, it's just
a usually I write them down. Somehow
that one didn't transfer from my written
notes to my calendar like I normally do
at the meeting. So, I appreciate it. I
could just do a calendar and nine state.
Yes. And I do want to note that Canon
Commissioner Canon Fletcher joined at
11:56.
And one more thing is that we have a
Junior Park Ranger program that I
created several years ago and won a
statewide award at ARPA and it starts up
in June and it is for 9 to 12 year olds
and we energize and educate them about
our natural environment via our park
system. Everything we do is outside
except for Wednesday mornings where we
attend the um uh hostel and our museum,
the MacArthur Museum. And other than
that, we are outside hiking, birding,
fishing, archery, and then they graduate
at the end of the week. We have a pizza
party and their parents come and they
receive a certificate.
They at on Monday they receive a
backpack full of gear and on Friday they
get to take it home and they also get a
badge and a t-shirt. So that starts up
this summer. It's a day camp. It's $50
per child. So if you know someone who
would love to attend, uh please send
them to me and they can go to our
website. Are there any questions?
How many kids normally attend that that
program? the park rancher program. I
take 10 per session and there's three
sessions.
That's Yeah, that's cool. I remember
they talked about it last year. It's I'm
glad to
see those continue and, you know, keep
getting bigger. That's great. Do we know
anything about the Have they already
started the I'm sure they have. It's
real close to starting.
like do we know roughly how many kids
they're looking at and that kind of
thing?
Uh, no, but they usually do fill up.
I think there's at least 300 signed up
so far.
All right. Anything else for
Karen? All right. Um I don't think we
have any presentations today. So
um we will go into unfinished business.
Um I'll start with the JT and the master
planning committee
subcommittee. Any updates? JT?
No, we hadn't had a chance to meet um
uh in recent months. So, um hopefully
getting that back on board uh next
month. Okay.
Uh Quinton Marketing.
Uh yes. Uh Graham and I got to sit down
um either like a week ago or two weeks
ago um to talk about a plan for the
upcoming year um and some strategies
that he's he's using to um you know get
parks and wreck out there. Um, so you
know, I think I think we're going we
just kind of had an initial meeting to
talk about goals and and things of that
nature and and get to know each other.
And our next meeting, which we plan to
have this next month, um, we're going to
really focus on strategy. I also talked
to Leland and Graham um about content.
You know, everybody's always looking for
content. However, Parks and Rec has a
lot of content all the time. But if any
um members are or of this commission or
commissioners are at uh the local parks
and wrecks and want to take your picture
maybe about the sign or something cool
you see in the park, um please do so and
then we can send them to Graham and he
can kind of have a bank of all, you
know, some commissioners at different
places around the city. um and then use
them, you know, whenever he needs some
content to put in it to put on social
media or something of that nature. So,
like for instance, I was at Kana's uh
park this weekend, didn't take a
picture, no good. Nobody knows, you
know. So, um if you want to take a
picture, send it in to him. U you know,
we're not guaranteeing you you'll be on
the social media page, but you might be.
Did I say all that right, Graham?
Yeah. Yeah. And we just want to also
just demonstrate to the community that
our commission is involved and help
promote it. Yeah. Exactly. And then, you
know, this commission is a lot of people
from all different parts of the city. I
feel like that um has have different
outreach in different areas. And so,
like if they see me at Kuanas Park, they
might think, "Oh, that's great. I'm
going to try Kowanas Park." or if they
see JT at uh you know Bo Park, they
might say, "Oh, I didn't know Bo Park
was uh back open. You know, let me go
down there and check that out." So,
there's been a lot of activity with
opening new parks or Kanes Park or I
mean just and and all the playground
equipment is just fantastic. It's all a
lot of it's brand new and we want to
make sure the most people in Little Rock
know it's out there and available for
them to use for free. So, well, I mean
tax dollars, but for free at that time,
you know, no entry fee. How about that?
Could we get Graham's email address?
Uh, yeah, Graham, you want to throw it
in the chat?
Well, he's email some invites out, so I
think he'll we'll have it by then. So,
perfect. Yes. Otherwise, it's it's on
the email threads you've been on, but I
can um I'll be emailing y'all. And are
you typically the new social media
communication person? Um, that person
will be introduced next month. So, it
starts May 5th. Uh, she already started
and is sitting in the room, but Leland
wants to introduce her next.
I'm the marketing and data coordinator.
Okay. Sorry, I just saw it in the in the
report. So, and we're going to meet the
whole group on our next meeting. So,
we're looking we're very excited about
it.
We won't steal Leland's thunder
me. All right.
Um Sam is not present. The only thing I
have
for Parks Conservancy is they will be
I'm assuming for the May 21st I think.
Will they be taking the funds? Is that
who will get will take the funds I'm
assuming? Yes. Okay. And um Graham put
out a QR code for the invite. So if you
can't make it, I can't make it. I'll be
out of town unfortunately, but I plan to
donate using the QR code. So um thanks
Graham for doing that and sending it
out.
Um but um just point of uh to make is
when you have your subcommittee
meetings, if you could please remember
to record those uh meetings and send
those to Mahogany so we have a record of
those, we'd appreciate it. Okay.
All right. Even if it's if it's even if
it's just one commission member and
Graham as soon as that's not a that's
not a that's not a meeting. That's not a
meeting. So we don't have the court. No,
not those. If it's scheduled and more
than one scheduled notice that's going
to we can get into more specifics later,
but we'll Yes, I can send something out
to everybody. All right. Um commission
ideas, goals for 2025. I think we've
already kind of talked about that. Um,
we hel we held our first quarterly site
visit commission retreat at AMFA in
MacArthur Park on April 24th. So, I
appreciate everyone going to that. Our
next one, I think it's going to be in
July and I don't have it. I'll send a
email out when the next one's going to
be. Um, it's in July. I think it's in
July at the community center and I I'm
sorry, but I I'm drawing a blank on
where it's going to which one's going to
be. Uh, but I will send the email out of
when the next one's going to be. We
usually we'll probably do at the same
time for 4:00 again. Um, but I'll make
sure to send that. But we hope to have
everyone there um at the first Corley
site. Now the second it's not quly
trial because we're going to do three
three this year. We just had our first
one. So our second of three will be in
July. I will send information about that
because I don't know the date. July
10th. July 10th. Where's it going to be
at? Center.
Um, West Central. Okay. West
Central. I I'll make sure I'll send that
out just so we so we know. Um, thank
you, Summer. Uh, the Parks Commission
board presentation was held last week.
Um, was on May 6th. Appreciate everyone
coming. Summer, I think, was there.
Canon. Um I think Kamiya was there, you
were online, maybe Quinton, I don't
know. Um but I think it was a good
presentation. It was a very uh large
crowd there for another topic. So we did
get the benefit of that. We got more
people learning about what we did all in
2024.
Um so uh that I'm glad we got to do
that. So, we'll do that again in 2026 or
maybe later this year if we want to. So,
thank you all who attended and help with
the
presentation. Um, discuss special
meeting on March 19th. I think we've
already done that. Um, new date need for
May. We're doing that right
now. Um, upcoming reservoir park
fundraiser trios. We talked about that.
Is
there there is a way to apply or not
apply? There's a way to donate online,
but is there a way
[Music]
to are you we take keeping track of
who's coming? Is it RSVP or is it just
show up? Just show up. Okay. Have you
heard
anyone heard any comments or questions
at all?
Um about it? Anyone? I guess anyone? So,
anyone commissioners, anyone planning on
attending at all once?
I'll be there. Thank you, Summer.
That may or may not be my birthday, so
I'm not sure if I'm going to be there.
And I may be out of town anyway. So,
celebrate your birthday at what's better
than that. Yeah, I can think of a few
things. Start again.
Five.
I'll try to I I'll be
there. All right.
I mean, it's going to be really good
food. Yeah. Trios.
Okay. Any questions on unfinished
business? That last item, unfinished
business. I think we're going to talk
about in new business.
Um, any questions on unfinished
business? What I just went I know it was
a lot of items that we've done already.
Um,
okay. Just a reminder though that at the
site visits, uh, let's not discuss
anything that is business related to the
commission just so that we're all being
very much aware. I know you wouldn't put
as much on there. Were you there?
It was really good. We got to tour
MacArthur Museum and the park and then
we had uh some adult beverages at AMFA.
So, it's definitely a beautiful park.
Yes, s outside and scenery. Yeah,
I think in new business maybe we can
talk about what we want to
do and maybe this is more Leland, but we
want to do at West Central. Um, if you
want to bring like a ice chest doesn't
have to be adult, it can be something
else, but um we can talk about that for
new business next in June. So,
um Okay.
So, Mahogany sent uh an email out last
week that had uh resumeumés and
applications for people that are
interested in attending or being a
commissioner. Um and also neat I I a
couple of people that saw the you review
are actually very interested in becoming
a member. So, it's glad that we're I I'm
glad we did that presentation at board
because I think it's getting more more
interest in the in the commission. But
besides the fact
um we've gone back and forth over the
past couple months of how we're going to
do this because we're I think we're the
only commission that
approves the applications which are then
sent to the board directors for them.
Did I hear that right? Am I hearing that
right? Okay. Yes. You guys basically um
you make appointments and then the board
of directors
uh is going to would affirm those that
appointment.
Okay. So what do we need to do to do
business? So currently we have the
commission has four vacancies.
Um and so there were four applicants.
Um, you want to go over their names? Um,
and you can Simone, can you can you just
clarify? Are the four vacancies
including Canon or is that an additional
reappoint vacancy?
Um, the four vacancies do include Canon.
Um, I'm sorry in the commissioner.
It in Yeah, it includes the spot that I
am and I was a I think you may have been
too, Mike. Like I was a
midterm or whatever you want to call it
like a point like somebody
else, you know, had the three-year term
and
then I guess left and then I carried out
the rest of that term, like a year and a
half of it. Yeah, I'm not but um I knew
you were. I just wasn't sure if we had
kind of five vacancies or four total.
It's four total.
Yeah. And it was it's been confusing
since the beginning of the year because
I mean I think everyone's assumption at
least mine was that I was done and then
I've stayed on
because Simone found the rule or the
ruling or whatever. Uh so that's been a
little funny.
So, but Canon, if you I have your the
I'm sorry, Commissioner Fletcher, we
have your application for reappoint um
which would cover your vacancies. Then
there also are vacancies for
Commissioner Smith, Linda Smith,
Commissioner Ron Barah, and Commissioner
Quincy grant spots. So, the applications
we have for
um Cameron
 Christopher Kemp, and Mabel
Knight. Have you all had an opportunity
to we would just go over those and look
at that? And Chairman France, if I'm
overstepping, please let me know. No. Do
we vote on them today or do we just
discuss? You can do either. We can do um
a discussion. So, if you've had the
opportunity to look at their um
applications and resumes, you can vote
on them now. Um you can discuss and vote
on them. Okay. Um or we can just discuss
and then think about it and vote on it
next month. Okay. Hey, Ben, can I ask
one other clarification question? Are
each of the positions through the same
term or should we be
considering specific positions for
specific candidates? Perhaps
that one I do not know. Um I believe
that they
all are for individuals who have
resigned and not just um except for
Commissioner Fletchers. Um, so they
could each go into those terms. Um,
yeah, there's already a stagger for a
few of
them, like a staggered tier. I don't
Linda had a
really spreadsheet. I apologize. them up
in where I don't have my files. But um I
want to say if memory serves I
think I'm separate from the other three
like termwise like the four positions
that are open but I think two of them
are the same and one of them is a
different year if I remember it
correctly. So now that I asked the
question I realize I had some notes on
this that I think are accurate. I think
Linda's term just went full term and
expired the 31st of actually I had her
through
2024 January 2024. So that doesn't seem
right either. She got she got
reappointed for three years last year.
Okay. Okay. So hers hers is probably
through 2027. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then
I had you as um coming up 130 or
actually 131 2025 this year. Right.
Corre correct. And then who are the
other Ron Barah? I had him as 131 2026.
Correct.
And then who was the other person?
Quincy.
He we had to Oh, I didn't Yeah. I didn't
So we I don't think since he missed too
many meetings per the gota
the bylaws he he was relieved. Um he had
a chance to appeal it. I don't think he
he asked. So um
so do we want to discuss or do we want
to vote? If we need to discuss or vote.
I don't know if Kan needs to be online
or not.
He does. He does. Okay. Um so we can
talk bad about Ken if we don't want him
right in front of him. Yes. Yes.
Exactly. I've had worse. Well, I mean,
can can I make a motion just to ex to
accept them all and and vote in favor of
them for um all being on the board?
Oh, wow.
We have a second.
I was
I'd like to say one I'd be curious one
thing before we voted if that's okay.
Like just to put a pin in that for one
second. Does anybody know anybody here?
There was a couple like one said they
knew Leland, one said they knew somebody
else. Like I Yeah, I mean that I grew up
I grew up with Chris Chris Kemp.
Um, you know, I'm just I don't know much
about Cameron or the other person, but
he's a he's a good guy, cares about the
city. Um, I just I want to find
commissioners that a will hold here
every sec second Wednesday of the month
and will contribute.
Um, and I I think he would, but I I
don't know the other two. So, but I
don't think we we we have any other
applications at all. Right. These are
the four for the past four
months. So, right. And this isn't a is
this a vote that will then go to the
mayor's office to approve it. This is a
vote that would then go to the board of
directors to confirm. Yes. This is just
our support that we Okay. This is the
affirmation. This these would be the
board members that the board of
directors could veto essentially but is
more than likely to the commissioners.
I'm sorry. Uh can I uh just get
clarification on who seconded putting JT
commissioner first? Commissioner first.
Thank you. So so Ben um Kemp was
actually the only one I had question on
because I don't know him and on his
application he didn't like provide any
information. He provided his resume, but
like you know the the questionnaire that
says why do you want to be on a
commission or whatever seem like he
provided any information on that at all.
But so you feel pretty confident that he
would be engaged and participate. Well,
I know him as well. Um, his family's
been in Little Rock and involved in
Little Rock for generations.
And I was his sister, older sister's
age, but I've known him his whole life,
so I I think I feel good about it, too.
Okay.
All right. All those in favor of the
four applicants, let let me ask one one
other thing. The only other thing I had,
it seemed like one or two of
them, Parks and Wreck wasn't their
first or maybe they were. Maybe it was
Mabel. Like Regina, she wasn't. Parks
and Wreck was her second position. I
don't know if that matters. Like I guess
we that's
what's this this whole process is a
little
uh wonky for for a lack of a phrase for
me cuz like we don't talk to them per se
like I found out I was on the parks and
recck
commission like a day before the meeting
like no you know what I mean? like I
just don't know what the the process if
someone doesn't want to be that kind of
thing. So Ken and I saw that and that's
just their preferences. They have to
okay check what they're interested in.
From my perspective, this is just a you
know a checkpoint for us to raise our
hand if we have any reason not to push
one forward. Okay, perfect. Yeah, I was
impressed with everyone that that I
read. I read them all like a few weeks
ago. So,
um, yeah, I'll be quiet. Thank you.
Sorry. All right. Can we get a vote? All
those in favor of the four applicants to
be commissioners, all the four
applicants that will be voted on, the
board directors, please say I. I. I. I.
Anyone?
Nay. Okay. We have now voted that those
four
applicants will be voted
on. I'm not sure would it be I guess
they have it be have to be on the agenda
in two weeks. They would it would likely
be on the June 20th agenda. June 20th
agenda. Okay.
June 20th a Okay.
Does it take a couple weeks to get on
the agenda? It does. Okay.
And then if they voted on, would their
first meeting be in July?
Most likely. Okay.
All right. Um,
can just so I don't forget for new for
new business for next in the June
meeting, can we talk about since we have
new people coming on what
we're going to do as a commission to
like bring them on, bring them up to
speed.
Yeah, we can make that agenda on
onboarding for new commissioners. Um,
yeah, we can talk about that. It's a
good idea.
Um, and then on on that on that topic,
could we add that um we're going to they
can pick a committee or we'll sign one
to them.
Does that have to be voted on by like
the committee members or just I think I
think we can talk in the in the in the
June I guess July meeting we can talk
about what the subcommittees do if they
have any interest in it and I think in
the July meeting they can give their yes
or no and then we can vote on it.
That is I believe in agreement with our
bylaws with bylaws.
So yeah, their first meeting they can
they can we can talk about it and then
they can figure out which one they would
like to be
on. So agenda item go the onboarding
discussion. We do have the discussion
about July the July 10th site visit. Um
any other agenda items for for June?
Okay. I enjoy I enjoy hearing about the
summer camp program. So if we can not
like a full update but just like get
some number like because it will have
started by the June meeting. So numbers
where it's at that kind of thing. I
think it's good that can get then
promoted you know further uh social
media etc. But it's it's a good thing
for people to know exist. Um I think
it's a great program. We've we've
sponsored and uh several kids in the
past. So Okay.
And and then what about an update on the
Little Rock Open? Isn't that this week?
Isn't that like next weekend?
Uh it is the
20 I think maybe qualies like the
qualifying
starts next week maybe and then the
tournament is the last week. It's a
Memorial Day
week or Yeah, I think that's the I'm
pulling it up right now. I think that's
the the date.
Okay. I just wanted to throw that on
Leland's agenda. He'll probably give us
an update. I don't I mean I don't I
don't doubt it, but just uh seemed like
it had a lot of momentum last year and
he was really excited about it. Um and
so I just want to keep that going.
Anything else?
If if anyone has children or anyone
watching this later,
uh there are tons of volunteer
opportunities and the hours get to count
if your kids in public school towards
their community service hours, you know,
as required by the Learns Act. Um the
tournament is the 26th through June 1st.
It is free to the public. Uh, one of the
sponsors pays for what the equivalent of
the gate, ticket gate used to be. Uh, so
anyone can come like any time of day.
Uh, yeah. So, Ken, what do you recommend
the best time to go if you got
like the least crowds? I guess
there's never not crowds. the the best
time is
typically in the late afternoon so you
can sit on the stadium court in the
bleachers and stay in the shade. Um, but
it it gets hot out there, man. Like it's
usually one of the hotter tournaments
from talking with guys that have
competed in the past and I mean it's
just swampy in Arkansas. Uh they liken
it to playing at the, you know, flushing
at the US Open in August. I mean, it's
it's pretty brutal compared to most of
the other locations that they play.
Where where do you get on and sign up
for those volunteer opportunities?
Uh, your best bet is reaching out to the
Rebmen Tennis Center. Uh, and then Chip
Sterns is the director of the tennis
center and he is also the director of
the tournament and there are like
tournament volunteer staff that run like
the kids. Um, but there's ball kids. I'm
not sure if that's already full. But
then there's I mean kids that are moving
stuff around, you know, I mean just
setting stuff up, tearing stuff down,
the whole the whole nine yards. I mean
it's a production. It's a pretty big
production. So,
thank you. Yep. All right. Uh, we don't
have any boards here. So, no board and
feedback. Uh, we did you guys discuss uh
new business number eight, the change in
the vacancy process on the agenda. Did
you want to discuss that? I'm sorry.
I don't know what that is. So, okay.
Well, that's that's perfectly fine. All
right, that's okay. What is it? Um, I
believe there's Go ahead.
It it was regarding the vacancies on the
board and so I I think it would be good
to get feedback from our board liaison
once we
pass this along. Let's see what they say
about what's the future if there are
commission vacancies that we need to do.
We right now it's just what we're doing
now. which is it's a support level
support. We support these candidates and
it goes to is that we're doing now?
Right now you have appointed members and
the board will affirm them. It's kind of
like in the law making process of the
legislature has approved the the bill
and we just need the governor to sign
off on them. Okay. Situation. Is that
how it is currently? That is currently
how it is. So what do we need to change
the vacancy process?
Um our the parks and rec commission is
the only commission that appoints their
own members. Typically it is board down
instead of board up. Okay. I mean I
don't think it's I don't consider it
voting. I think it's we're just
supporting them and we give it to them.
I think it's just adds an extra layer of
of research on our behalf to look at
these applicants and and then we move it
up. I think it I think it our ways a
little better as as opposed because
ultimately it's going to be voted on the
board. So I don't think we're voting on
it honestly. I think we're just
providing support. So I'm I'm fine with
it, but I'm happy to to table it to next
month too. So I I agree. I think it's a
decent process and it's pretty easy. But
in any case, I think I in my opinion it
would be the board of directors that
would drive changing the process, right?
they would direct us or they would
change they would have to change the
ordinance, right? And then if they
change the ordinance, we would in turn
change to our bylaws to match it. Is
that true, Simone? That is correct.
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I agree with Mike.
Yeah, I think we're good with it. So,
are you good? I am. Um, I just received
the terms if you guys the terms of
um everyone's terms, but they do not
have Oh, okay. Have Commissioner Barah's
old term expired at the end of January
2026. I can go through those if you'd
like or um we can not. It's whatever you
prefer if you wanted those dates for
appointment purposes. Personally, I
don't care as long
as Canon gets the gets his full term.
Understood.
Okay, sounds good. Well, I think that's
the end of the meeting. Um, we will meet
next at June 11th at like city hall
board director's room um due to the
construction at the university center.
So,
um meeting adjourned. Thank y'all. Let's
get a motion and a vote. Oh, motion.
Motion to adjurnn.
Second. Second.

the back and come up the back
way at city hall? Yes. Okay. Sweet. And
