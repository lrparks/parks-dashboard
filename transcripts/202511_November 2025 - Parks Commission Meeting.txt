Careful. You got
Let's
see. There it is.
>> Can I switch
just wanted to let y'all know the mics
are hot and we are recording.
>> Okay.
>> Even though we haven't started yet.
>> So,
That's kind of
All
right. Are you ready to get started?
All right. Uh Ben uh sent let me know
that he was not going to be able to be
here um today and asked me to to to
conduct the meeting. So I want to
welcome everyone. Thanks for coming
today.
Um, let's start with a roll call.
Commissioner Ben France,
>> Commissioner Quinton Whiteside
>> here,
>> Commissioner Samuel Ellis,
Commissioner Canon Fletcher
>> here,
>> Commissioner Mike Bernado
>> here,
>> Commissioner Summer Campbell
>> here.
>> Commissioner Shenia Woods.
Commissioner Christopher Kemp,
Commissioner Mabel Knight.
We have four and we're one short of a
quorum.
>> All right. Well, we'll go ahead and um
skip over number three then for approval
of the minutes, right? If we're short of
quorum, and go into citizen
communications. Do we have any citizens
that are out there that would like to
communicate with the board today?
All right. Hearing none, we will move on
to the director's report slashstaff
reportevents.
>> Okay. Thank you. Um I'll just short
short here today. Um but I just would
like to see if there's any questions for
the staff reports before move to the
next.
>> Yes.
>> Okay. Um,
a a couple different questions on the
admin.
Yeah, on the admin report. Um, the PIT
funding will expire December 31.
Um, prevention, intervention, youth. Is
that getting backfilled by anything or
is it the city moving that fun?
>> The PIT funding is a yearly commitment.
>> Okay. So, we've um received new funding
every year.
>> Okay.
>> It was just the way it was worded made
me think like, okay, is it not getting
backfilled or
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. We receive roughly $200,000 yearly
that helps uh the biggest part of that
funds are um playground summer
playground program and um and some
different facilities.
>> Okay. What does PIT stand for?
>> Prevention, intervention, treatment.
>> Thank you. It's
>> funding that was set aside. But I don't
have the history of it. I know Sue or
Angelo might if y'all wanted to know the
history, but I mean it's it's been
around for quite a while.
>> Yeah, when I looked it up. Yeah, it's
been a while.
>> Um the only other thing on there on
admin was the
pavilion rentals and then it said
revenue for October and it was lower
than September. So, it may have been a
typo one of the months, but then
saying that the rentals are going to
cease in the winter. So, we we've just
put out a notice that we've closed all
of our pavilions to reservations in the
winter. It's just a simply matter that
um staffing for reservations is not um
it's a it's a low use time because of
the temperature in winter. Um but the
bigger challenge that we face too if we
were to leave more of them open would be
the utility aspect, water. Um so we turn
off water and different utilities like
that. Um but historically we just
haven't had a large use for them. So
then we turn them back on in spring and
okay
>> um they still be uh able to be used for
a first come first serve type scenario.
So we're not going to not clean them or
there's not a gate around them. You can
still go down to Murray Park and use the
pavilions.
>> Okay. I was just I I didn't remember
that in the past, but it probably occurs
and I just didn't.
>> Yeah. The other challenge is too is like
restroom. We close a lot of our
restrooms. A lot of portaotties get
pulled or all of our portaotties get
pulled out and we're starting that
process now.
>> Um splash pads are turn, you know, it's
just kind of a it's a slower season for
>> uh outdoor activities. Yeah,
>> for sure.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. How's this double checking?
>> That's good. I mean, that's some of my
notes that I had to share. Just to
piggyback on that from a reporting
perspective, it'd be helpful like where
you have revenue for October if you also
included what the forecast was so we
could just see whether you know we're
trending upward or downward from what
was forecast. We do have um previous
years, correct? Right. So you can see
how we're going up or down in terms of
previous from previous years, right? We
could I guess show a goal of of for
future, right? So when we do the budget
process, is there not like a
a next year forecast that says here's
what we anticipate? You know, we we
based our our budget. We're expecting
these expenses, but we're also expecting
there's revenue. I mean, what does this
151 relate to? To me, it's just a big
number. I don't know.
>> Right. So, our our revenue, we we don't
focus as extensively as like if you were
a private company on revenue because all
of our private revenue goes back to the
general fund. Um I would go back to um
staff and finance and they do a revenue
report and they are looking at the
revenue and saying okay well previously
you know over the years you've generated
$300,000 in parental rental and it's
down or or they would look more at a
bigger number like golf or something
like that and when they do those kind of
numbers and they come to us and say you
know what are your challenges or what
are you why are you down in revenue um
we look at a
smaller scale, you know, but um we don't
forecast exactly like how many times
also pavilion is going to be rented at
$65 and say we really need to get a
couple more rentals than that. We just
haven't done that
>> right now. I mean, I wouldn't expect it
at that level for this, but
>> yeah,
>> you know, as far as a 151, there's for
me there's no context.
>> Yeah,
>> I don't it's it's a number. Maybe good,
it may be bad, but I can't tell. Well,
Angela here, our deputy director of
administration, works on all those
numbers and so she'll take that as a
note and we'll add some some more
information to that. So, thank you.
>> Yeah, I don't think it'll be a problem
comparing year to year. And once I'm
looking at this, if you're looking at
the
>> Yeah, you have to come up to the
microphone.
>> Okay. Once you're looking at if you're
going back to the the previous month, um
I'm thinking it was like 240 something
and I'm thinking that was a typo. I'm
thinking once I think about it, it may
have been 141
>> somewhere in that range. So yeah, once I
thought about it, it is a significant
difference from the 151. So previous
month was 140 something rather than two
something. Um, but we can do if you just
want to look at something to compare, we
can do the previous year of 2024 if
that'll help.
>> I think that would give you some
context. Yeah. Thank you.
>> Can I ask a followup to what you said,
Leland? You said the
revenue that you all collect goes to the
general fund. Like it doesn't in fund
accounting. It doesn't stay in parks and
wreck. goes back to the overall city
operating fund. I guess
>> that's correct.
>> Okay. I just wasn't sure.
>> Wasn't aware of that actually.
>> Yeah, that's all of our revenue goes to
the general fund and then it comes back
to us to support it. So parks generally
has a approximately $12 million budget.
We raise about $2.5 million in revenue,
two and a half to three depending on the
year or depending on our assets and what
we have. And um and that goes into the
general fund and then general fund turns
around and funds all of us for
everything.
>> Not to mention all the special project
accounts and all kinds of different
grant funds and everything else,
>> right?
>> Yeah, that's on the operating side.
Yeah, that's what you're talking about.
Okay.
>> Anybody else have any more questions
about the staff reports?
>> Um I don't have a question about the
staff reports. I do just want to uh make
a point that uh Commissioner Woods is
here. So, we do have a quorum.
>> Well, great. Um
>> yeah, if you want to go back and
>> Okay. Do you want to finish your report
first, Leland, or do you want me to go
back and approve the minutes?
>> I'll be good if I can just finish. I
don't have much today. Um I just want to
cover next our agenda items.
>> Um just most recent we um took Southside
Playground. That's a long um process
where we've been needing to replace the
playground at Southside Park. Um our
operation staff is working on that. Uh
and then we've also approved uh
Riverfront and Murray. Um those are two
larger playgrounds and we're not
replacing the entire playgrounds. We're
just replacing components of those
playgrounds. Um and um those are the
bigger board agenda items. And then the
other things that I just like to update.
Some of them will be hopefully covered
in uh events. So, I'm not going to go
into the details of like what's happened
this past week and all these great
events, but um I did want to share that
we have a Western Hills grand opening
ribbon cutting ceremony for Western
Hills at 3 p.m. this afternoon. So, I
know it's short notice, but anybody that
can make it out, that'd be great. Um and
then December 3rd at 7 p.m. we'll have
our um master plan. The completion of
our master plan for 30 crossing will be
presented to um the city. Um and I'll be
sharing more information on that in
terms of location. Um and I I'll give
everybody here a flyer and and uh share
that also with the public. And um that's
kind of generally it's kind of a little
bit shorter information this month than
last. And um I'll open it up for any
questions that you have for me.
Um, I was going to ask a question about
I think the paper yesterday talked about
a um the finishing the river trail. Is
that you or who who is who is
responsible for
>> I can cover that.
>> Okay.
>> Um that is not the uh parks department.
That's in front of Dillards is a big
section and it's in the uh public
rideway.
>> So public works has been managing that.
Um, and what you heard about was a um
they shared some um recent completed uh
conceptual drawings for uh improvements
to that area at the Dumbar Community
Center uh this past week. Um believe
that was Wednesday night. I'm not I
don't quite recall. Um but anyway, I'm
sure you can get that information from
public works or not sure where that
information is publicly held, but so
what's park's role in any of that if
any?
>> Yeah. So, uh, park's role in the
Arkansas River Trail is we're really
heavily focused in, for example, an
example of that would be in Two Rivers
Park. We resurface part of the Arkansas
River Trail. So, any of them that's in
the parks, you know, um, property, we
um, maintain, take care of, we do
maintain other areas of the River Trail,
too, that are not in a named park area.
Um but then when it gets into other
areas like on street, so that's part of
the highway 10 there in front of
Dillards that the public works
department's working on. Um or there's
some other uh trail areas that the uh
public works department's working on
that are on private property. Um we
still work together on them, but they'll
be the lead of them.
Anyone else have any questions?
All right, hearing none. Um, let's go
back in the agenda to the approval of
the October meeting minutes. Did
everyone have a chance to review the
meeting minutes for October?
I'm hearing no comments. I'll assume
that's a yes. Um, does anybody have any
motion they'd like to make regarding the
meeting minutes in October?
>> Motion to approve.
>> Do I have a second?
>> Second.
Uh all if anyone's opposed say something
now
hearing none uh the meeting the minutes
are approved.
All right. Now we will go to
presentations. Um and we're doing a
>> you have events on there.
>> Oh events. I'm sorry. Thank you.
>> I'll help you with that. I don't believe
Karen Sykes has a report. Um Graham does
and I think he also has something to
tell you about some of his u staff as
well. You're going to share that today?
>> Sure. Um, regarding events coming up,
the, as Leland said, we have the Western
Hills ribbon cutting today at three.
Love to see you all there. Um, Marathon
has the ugly sweater race coming up at
Two Rivers Park. That's on December
20th.
And we really just finished up a lot of
events here in the past few weeks. We've
had a lot going on. We had the um, W six
block party at Kanes Park. That was a
success. Um the squash till you drop
trail run was this past weekend. Had a
lot of a big turnout there and lots of
fall events, Halloween events that we
just wrapped up. So um we'll have more
on the horizon as Christmas approaches.
But that's it for now. And then yes,
Gabrielle Pervvis has stepped down as
the communications and social media
specialist. So her last day was
last Thursday.
Oh, no. Um, do we know why she left or
um do you know where she's going? She
went to a marketing agency just in North
Little Rock. It mainly so that she could
work from home. It's a hybrid role.
>> She was in Conway, so she
didn't want to commute every day.
>> We hate that.
>> Yeah, she was doing a great job. Um, and
I guess, uh, something that she
highlighted in doing her job is that I
feel like social media was really taking
off, you know, so I'm sure you're making
it priority to find somebody like her to
fill a spot or is that is that a
>> Yeah. Okay. Right. I thought she was
doing great.
>> She was.
>> Um,
>> okay. Um,
>> I got I got a quick question.
>> Yeah. Go ahead. Um,
I'm happy to help you guys if if at all
if that's something that you're
interested in, but I'm just curious kind
of because we've had a bit of attrition
with that position. Um,
I guess within the last 6 months to a
year. I'm just curious like how are we
posting or is it just kind of we just
post and pray and we just hope somebody
applies or are you guys kind of being a
bit intentional about how we're looking
to fill that role?
>> Um,
there there's a lot to unpack there. Um,
but I'll share a little bit and then you
can ask some more questions if this is
the direction you're going with it. Um,
so the parks department for years went
without any kind of marketing or anybody
telling our story or we didn't even know
how to get on social media really. Um, I
changed that and we got the position
hired. Um, and we had some good staff
and they moved on to other positions. Um
and then um because of some of that
changes I redirected kind of the the
layout and Graham is new to that role
and he actually is in position to where
he actually uh manages the social media
coordinator under him. So it used to be
like just two individual um staff
members and so now Graham is over that
and um that's changed some some roles to
where the social media person is a
little less in hierarchy and Graham is a
little bit more in hierarchy and one of
the purposes of that is that I have a
personal goal to um make this department
accredited and so his his goal or his
biggest job description is one besides
marketing the department is
accreditation. And so we also learned
through the process that social media as
big of a role as it is, there are a lot
of people that do social media. And so
that kind of played into how we
redirected some of the job descriptions
of those.
>> Okay. I'm not saying we have it exactly
right, but I do I'm I'm glad we found
Graham and uh I liked Gabby, too. But so
we found some good uh members, but
hopefully we can figure that out. Also,
again, we are in the meantime going to
figure out a few other ways to um keep
the ball rolling. We're not going to
stop social media until we find somebody
else. We'll use some um private help and
some other ways to do that. So, um does
that help answer some of your questions?
>> Uh-huh. It helps. Yes. All right. Thank
you.
Um, okay. Anybody else have any
questions?
I'd just like to say that I went down to
the um Kynis Park party and it was a lot
of fun. So, I didn't get there till a
little later, but it was it was great.
So, so I actually appreciate that. I I
went and uh spent a couple hours at the
um the OUP trail race. And correct me if
I'm wrong cuz I still don't believe
this, but I think the winner, so it's a
as many laps you can do in 6 hours. And
the person that won it did what was it
like 11 laps or something?
11 or 12 at like almost three something
miles a lap. So they ran more than a
marathon. They ran something like 30
plus miles
>> in the woods. What?
>> Yeah.
So, I don't know. That person needs to
get a extra
>> have Mike come and give a a report out
on that.
>> One of those uh Little Rock Marathon
medals, huh?
>> Biggest in the country.
>> I was there and they kept running by. I
was like, "Gosh, what what lap is this?"
And they're like, "This is my fifth
lap." And I mean, it's just like nothing
to them.
>> Wow.
>> Anyway, so we're all we're all made a
little different, right? So,
>> well, that's great. I just want to say I
thought y'all did a great job and and
and keep it up. So, thanks. All right.
Now, we are to uh presentations.
Section 13. Does anybody have a
presentation on that or is that left
over?
>> I don't believe we have a presentation,
but if Simone, if you'd mentioned just a
few words about where we stand in our
process
>> right now, right now, we're just
reviewing everything, making sure we
have all the ducks in a row before we
bring it back to you guys. Um, just so
that we're ready to move forward. The
goal is to be ready to have um the
public hearing, which is one of the last
steps uh either in December or January,
but that's our working goal for right
now. But we're we're working on having
everything ready for you guys.
>> Well, before we can have the public
hearing, we need to have a presentation
to the commission, right?
>> That is correct. Um, but that that's
kind of the steps that we're looking at
just to make sure we've hit the boxes
and done everything we need to do so
that we can schedule everything
correctly and together.
>> Okay. Thank you. So, is the is the plan
to have a presentation to the commission
in December and then turn around and
have the potentially the um
open meeting? I I mean, I guess it's
open too, but whatever other meeting in
past that in December and then January
or January,
>> we have not cited that yet.
>> The timing is is something like that,
but we're not in any urgent matter to to
move forward. So, we're just trying to
make sure we got to get everything
advertised and scheduled. And yes, you
would have the presentation then a a
public hearing and do we try to do all
that in December? That would be a goal,
right? But if we miss that goal, then
January or even February would be okay.
I just we didn't we we'd like to get it
accomplished, but
>> but we also want all of our eyes dotted
and tees crossed too, right? So,
>> there's not an urgency to where we end
up skipping a step or doing something
wrong and we have to start over again.
So,
>> yep.
>> And appreciate Simone's
help on all that. So,
>> exactly right. And I was just going to
say thanks for keeping the ball rolling.
Seems like it's on your priority list.
So, thank you.
>> Of course.
>> All right. Um unfinished business.
Um any subcommittee reports? Um none
from the marketing committee. Um but
what about uh
planning committee?
No further update other than what Simone
provided.
>> Great. And then I guess um Ellis is on
the um other advisory committee
subcommittee and he's not here. So we
will move on from there. Um
>> sorry going to interrupt that there was
no subcommittee for there was no master
plan subcommittee meeting today that
there was not enough.
>> Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
And now um oh on subcommittees too. I
know the um you know let's talk about
put that on the agenda. I mean I guess
it'll stay on the agenda but let's put
everybody on uh make sure everybody's on
a subcommittee um in December. So if
you're not on one, think about what you
want to be on. If you want to chair one,
think about which one you'd want to
chair. If if you want to stay on as
chair, let's get that lined up in
December if possible. So then we can
roll into January already having
subcommittee set up and then also on
that I would like to everybody has to be
on subcommittee. I think they already
are but just reiterate that and then
when new people get put on maybe we'll
have a procedure for how you're
automatically put on the committee with
like the least amount of people or
whatever. So
>> okay um let's go on quick question. Do
we have vacancies right now or are we
full boat at this point?
Mahogany, do you know the answer to
that?
>> Currently, we have three vacancies.
>> Okay. We need to start working on that,
too. Um, so let's see that on the
>> the application is out there. Um, and
the uh city clerk and city manager are
aware and so it it is out there if y'all
want to start um making it known.
>> Well, well, that's great. Would you do
we know when the deadline is for them to
>> the rolling? Oh, it's a rolling
deadline. Rolling open.
>> Okay. So, if anybody has any friends, we
need to encourage them that they think
would be good for this commission to
sign up, right? That's what you're
trying to tell us.
>> Yes.
>> And if they do sign up, um, their
application is good for one calendar
year. So, their application will die
December 31st of 2025. So, they'll have
to reapply January 1 if we have another
opening. So, just make sure that if
they're not selected by then that we
start over.
>> Okay. And then we've had some people
>> Hang on. Let me So you're saying that
even if they apply now, their
application is only good to the end of
the year. It's not good for 12 months.
>> That's correct.
>> Okay.
>> Like the because it's just that cut off
date is just a clean date to say, "Okay,
then we can go.
>> I'm here."
>> And then what about uh Mr. Kemp? Is his
uh is he absent teed out or does he's
okay?
>> He's okay.
>> Okay, great.
All right. Uh, any other questions about
subcommittees or uh, members of the
commission? I
>> I've got a just a quick question for
Mahogy. Do you know if we have any
applicants
right now for parks?
>> Currently, no. I haven't been made aware
of any and um, our city clerk stays on
top of that and she would send us if uh,
it to me immediately if we got some. Um
there is one um commission member uh who
hasn't been present um during this time
and that's uh Miss Mabel Knight and so
after this meeting um this will um she
will meet the qualification for a
removal um after
>> so that would then be a fourth vacancy.
>> Yes.
>> So y'all we need to we need to populate
this commission. We need to talk to
people we know. Andrea, I bet you've got
some people out in W six
>> because that would make it really
difficult to have a quorum.
>> Yeah. I had a acquaintance I ran into uh
this last weekend and
went out of my way to text. Here's the
link. Here's the form you need to fill
out. You know, I mean, trying to
move some people that way. I said, "Hey,
even if parks and wreck ain't what you
want, you can it's a general
application, I think, to, you know, pick
the two or three you want." So, and
Mahogany, I was told by um a person that
they did apply. So, if you can double
check that and if there's not anybody in
Q, let me know so that I can follow back
with them and find out what you know if
we're missing something.
>> Absolutely.
and and and just an idea, maybe we could
do a social media post about uh the
commission and and and get some traction
that way, especially if we all share it.
Um because I I I know the social media
game has been really strong lately.
Thank you, Graham. And I hope we find
somebody replace Gabby soon. She was
doing a great job. But I think that
might be helpful. It's I think the
largest commission or one of the largest
as far as number of of people on it. Um
and uh it's important. I mean we do a
lot of work. We've got a lot of parks.
Uh so we need to
>> we need to get out there and find some
folks.
>> I'd like to ask a clarification on that
question or that comment. Are you
reporting that there's a shortage of
people applying for commissions? Because
that's not something I've ever really
heard of. I've never Okay.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
>> Okay. So, yeah, we could definitely put
something out there. We I didn't know
that.
>> Yeah. And then I think if if if Graham,
correct me if I'm wrong, but if if you
know, you put out a social media post
like on Instagram, that's where I see a
lot of them or Facebook and then we all
comment, doesn't it go higher up on the
more people will see it?
>> Yeah, it will.
>> So, I don't know if we're like
conspiring, but you know, if everybody
would comment and say,
>> it's a good conspiracy. It's a great
It's a great commission, you know. Let
everybody join, then maybe more people
will see it, right?
>> Comment and share the post.
>> Comment comment and share, right? That's
what we're supposed to do. Okay. So,
everybody, if you see it, please comment
and share. Um, even if you only have
like 50 followers like me, I'm sure
it'll some algorithm will run. And I
don't even know if I have that many.
Probably like 12. Um, okay. So, so, um,
either way. Okay, great. So, everybody,
number one priority is probably filling
up this commission. Okay. Thank you. Um,
>> and again, it's a general application.
So, even if the person maybe parks and
wreck and their, you know, thing,
there's other things they can apply to
as well.
>> Yeah.
>> So, just it's a city-wide thing. I mean,
it's I think
>> but they do they check a box and they'll
usually check, you know, two or three
and um
>> but yeah, I'm I'm I'm concerned if we
have we already were three short and we
will have four short, it will be very
difficult uh next year to have quorum.
Okay. Well, we're going to make that's
the priority. Um the second one request
uh to put a photo of themselves. Let's
just go ahead and take that off if we
can cuz I mean I don't think anyone's I
I try I was running I was telling Leland
I was trying to train for this marathon
that I signed up for cuz for a lot of
reasons but um and I mean I was I was at
Cheetum Park running down there and I
was trying to take a picture of myself
with a sign and I can't I can't do it.
It looks terrible, you know. And so so I
I think that's just a hard a very
>> No, no, I don't have
>> hook you up with Virgil Miller, the king
of selfies. Really? Okay.
>> Maybe he can come in here and give us
citizen communication. Come here and
tell us how to do it
>> because
>> Oh, Lord. I mean, these angles I was
hitting on my chins at were not good. I
mean, I was like, I got to get out of
here. So, um, okay. So, but let's just
to go ahead and take that off. Everybody
knows that. I mean, that's been 12 times
this year with zero response. So, um,
just for the record, I submitted a
couple of photos.
>> You have Should we leave it on then?
>> No, no, no. That That's it.
>> Okay.
We can Okay. Okay. Great. Um, let's go
um to uh I'm just going to finish this
unfinished business first and then
presentation list selection for the next
meeting. Does anybody have anything
they'd like to present on for the next
meeting or somebody from parks to come
in and talk about?
Um I know there was a lot of questions
about budgets. Um do y'all have somebody
that could come in and talk to about the
budget? When is y'all's budget due?
That's not due till June though, right?
>> No, we're in budget. We're we're in
budget series right now. I can I can I
would be the one most likely to talk for
the majority of the budget.
>> Okay. Um outside of that then it would
be getting into say you know like Justin
would be able to share about his budget
for operations right and it would be
more like these are the challenges or
this is the impacts that I have they
don't you know then they report to me
about what their needs are and then I
report that to the city board um and we
can definitely cover some of that if
that's helpful. Um
>> is is anybody else interested in that?
>> Could we next month
>> since we're in the throws of it or is
that and just a third early or
>> we would be reporting out on our 2025
budget. We wouldn't our 2026 budget is
not we don't have anything to report out
on yet. So,
>> Gotcha.
>> Okay. When is that due?
>> Do you have is it a due date?
>> We've already presented once to the
board.
>> Okay.
>> Um and now my understanding maybe one of
the board members here would like to
share, but my understanding is I guess
Nicholas the CFO will be presenting
something to the board sooner than
later. I don't know if that's on the
agenda yet, but
>> it's not on the agenda yet, but it will
be in the month of December. Uh, but in
theory, we have to we like to pass the
budget at the end of this calendar year,
but we don't have to pass the budget
until January, the end of January 2026,
but there there have been a lot of
moving parts. So, uh, we've had a
preliminary budget workshop, but we
haven't actually seen the numbers and I
expected that to happen the next couple
of weeks.
What I could offer if you wanted just to
entertain the budget competation would
be is each deputy director could say
share you know three points of of
information about their budget and three
you know challenges or something behind
their budget that they've focused with
or you know different I mean there's
different things in there like one of
them would be is um AT&T has charged
more for their um landbased telephone
systems and so our utility telephone
system budget for each facility is X and
it doesn't meet what we need anymore.
And so what are we doing about that? And
we're doing a lot to to try to I mean
it's a big thing for it went from like
four grand to $40,000 in some places. So
um we're switching over to internet. So
I mean those are different
conversations, but we could go down into
a rabbit hole real quickly. And so it's
just
however you want to get into that. I
mean, we have a we have a budget book
that we can put up on the and talk about
individual community centers and their
budgets or into programs or I mean, it's
kind of that's a whole
we've done it once this year already
where I kind of gave a a broad overview,
but maybe if there was a particular area
and we wanted to focus on something, we
could narrow in on that with staff. But
again, y'all let us know and we can go
from there.
Are are there any areas this year?
So, you had your budget set up towards
the end of last year. Are are there any
areas I haven't noticed a lot saying
like, hey, we're overrunning like huge,
but are there any areas that you're not
overrunning because like you just can't
even get to it. Like I mean it do you
have problems like in your budget that
aren't? Yeah, we have a ton of um so I
mean everything I say almost every day
is so somebody says, "Well, why are you
not cutting the grass and we're apart?"
You, you know, if I had a blank
checkbook, I we would be finding
somebody to make sure they're out there
cutting the grass every day. Um a lot of
it is us trying to make sure I've put a
big emphasis this year on not running
into the red. Um and so we've done some
of that in the past because it was a
real need to get things, you know, taken
care of. we had challenges or trash or
whatever it was and so go spend some
money and either our staff would do it
or we would contract it out. Um I mean
another example would be is cleaning
restrooms. Everybody would like to have
a cleaner restroom. I would prefer that
as well. We've, you know, looked at
having vendors price cleaning our
restrooms. It doesn't fit our budget
currently. It just doesn't. We just
don't have the funding to do that. So we
have staff that clean the restrooms. Do
they clean them as well as if we were
spending thousands, you know, tens of
thousands of dollars cleaning them? No.
But I mean, those are decisions that we
have to make on how do we do this? How
often do we pick up trash or, you know,
how often do we trim the the limbs or
weed the the flower beds or are we do we
have staff to do the flower beds anymore
because we use the staff to do the
flower beds to maintain the ballpark
because we don't have staff to maintain
the ballpark, you know, or all. I mean,
there's hundreds of scenarios that, you
know, we could get into.
>> Well, and I look at us as more of a
sounding board, right? Like,
I'd be happy to have those conversations
here. Like, I think that that
at least then it's in the public record,
right? And people know it's occurring
and that there
>> Yeah. So that's,
>> you know, I mean like
>> because I I get it like we talked a
little bit before after or I talked to
Justin or you know any of the
>> uh liaison here heads of departments and
I I know the money's tight and I guess
that's my question
overarching question to the uh
ladies on the board is
where are we what are they looking at
preliminarily right now overall as a
city up down sideways
on just a budget like I mean is it
>> well I
>> think it was a dollar is it at 90 cents
or $110
>> I can tell you just in a nutshell it's
it's not just parks it's most of our
departments uh approximately 75% of our
budget goes to public safety so that
does not leave a whole lot for the 12
other city departments and unfortunately
parks is often the first department to
get cut uh sad but it's just true and
that is why we have so much deferred
maintenance in our parks. Um the city uh
departments were told early on that they
needed to cut approximately 7% out of
their budget. That that's a lot. Um of
course it would be a different story had
the sales the last two sales tax
initiatives passed because they were
heavy on parks, but they didn't. Uh so
it's it's just the that's just the ugly
truth. Uh, and I know Leland's been here
long enough that he he sees that the and
I I don't know if I'm 99% this this is
true. The department most affected is
parks.
>> So, what's the breakdown on your
operating budget of uh headcount versus
like
hard cost if you want to call it that
way? Like what's a soft cost versus hard
cost? And I'm not like you don't have to
tell me an exact number, but like 50/50.
>> So that kind of those kind of questions
I'd get to a certain point to where that
that would be something Justin could
report on next month. Or if we get into
more detail, I'd say January or
something. But I think questions like
that, like a lot of people would say,
"Well, how much money do you have? Why
haven't you replaced the window or the
air conditioner in the Dumbar community
center or whatever?" Well, we're waiting
until it burns to the ground in terms of
the air conditioner because we don't
really have the money just to go
outwardly preventatively
maintenance-wise replace all the air
conditioners. Even though they're 25
years old, we want them to run as long
as possible because we don't have the
money to to to put them new in. Um I
mean the the I just got information
about the heater at the indoor pool at
Tim Daily. the heater for the water. One
of them has just, you know, stopped
working. Um, and so, you know, should we
have replaced that a long time ago?
Maybe not a long time ago, but it was on
the list of, hey, we need to watch that.
But we just don't have the funding
mechanism to always preventively fix
everything like you should be able to.
There's a life cycle of everything. We
know a lot of the times what those life
cycles are and we our goal should be
replacing these things. You know, if a
roof needs has a life cycle of 30 years,
we should be looking at replacing that.
What is it? How does it look at 25?
Okay. Our budget is fixed for let's
replace it at 30 instead of waiting
until it's a problem.
>> Yeah. Until you have water in the
ground.
>> But that's the challenge of managing a
budget.
>> Sure. Um and you know knowing some of
those numbers that we have and you know
sometimes things happen, storms happen
and all of a sudden we have all this
money that goes out to fix certain
things and then somebody would say that
watching well then you get federal funds
or FEMA money or insurance dollars. Yes,
but those all things come in late. I
mean there's it's there's a whole bunch
of differentity that it's going to be
what they said it was when it started
with the FEMA stuff like I'm all
>> sort of will we go gain new park
locations or um or different
perspectives or um or things change
anyway. So,
>> so
>> yeah, my my last I mean I
I think it would be great maybe next
time we meet
and and I don't know, set it up like a
5:15 or something, but everyone gets a
couple things, but one of the things
that would be helpful,
I think I already know the answer, but
it would be helpful for us to know, but
then the general public that can watch
this and read a transcript or whatever
uh to understand
when Miss PC says a seven or 8% cut when
you're already running at,
and I'm making up a number, but 80%
on your operating budget being personnel
and 20% being
other costs. Um,
it's hard, right? It's a hard decision.
You're talking about people. You're not
talking about like cutting out,
>> you know, toilet paper.
>> Yeah. Let me help clarify that seven or
7% or that was a homework assignment,
>> right?
>> And you know, so there there is no
consideration of that at this time that
I'm aware of. But just to be clear,
>> right? It's just
I think it'd be good for everyone to
understand sort of just a baseline of
where the where the spending lands so
that
when those things occur that, you know,
we can advocate as well or go to, you
know, city hall meetings and advocate or
whatever. I mean, it's
>> uh
some are hard.
>> Something I was saying to me on that is
the timing of all this. So, right,
>> we'd be back here in the middle of
December. And I don't know what the
conversation board level is going to be
in between all that or right after.
>> Um, I'd really there's one side of me
that says, well, let's wait until we see
what our budget is and then we could
report out on what our results from that
is going to be. Um, at this point, we've
discussed the budget. We've shared the
budget. Our board has, you know, leaison
have heard some of our concerns, our
desires. Um, I think this is cooked
enough for us from I mean from their
standpoint. It's now it's their turn.
Um, if that would be okay with the
>> So, you think January would be a better
time to talk about the budget for the
upcoming year?
>> Just based on
let's talk about in December maybe and
see where the board stands on things.
>> I I truly don't know what's going to
happen. So,
>> okay. Well, we'll we'll we'll table
that. Anybody else have any other u
presentations they'd like to hear? Oh,
>> I just wanted to make a comment. So just
just from perspective I know things are
like you said are done differently
publicly versus privately but you know
just like from my perspective when I
used to be responsible for budgets and
things the way we would do is we'd start
off with a planned budget with all the
line items right to whatever level of
detail you want to go and then but then
we would have you know here's our
anticipated funding sources here's our
anticipated expenditures and we have it
month by month through the year and then
as the year went you had actual versus
forecast
and so you could very quickly see
variances so you didn't need to focus on
all the minutia but you could quickly
see when something was 20% different
than what you thought it was
>> and then we would you know I was an
account major so I would have to justify
with a few bullets why is this and and
lots of times there's good reasons why
there was you know why the situation was
but at least you could you know say you
know well here we had a you know tornado
damage but here we also had a variance
revenue because we got this insurance
money, whatever.
>> Anyhow, I know I'm not telling you guys
how to do it.
>> In my mind, I'm thinking, man, we used
to do that because we would review it
every month to say, are we on track? Are
we are we off track? And and do we know
why? And can we
>> need to change something along the way
as we're managing it?
>> Yeah. That I mean, we're we do that. I
mean, in urban forestry, we have a
contract line item. We have all these
different lot items, right, for each
expense and contracts is is short. I
mean, it's I don't know the exact
number, but we utilized all that to hire
um contractors to come and cut trees
down that are hanging over utility lines
and and streets that were considered
emergency. And so we blew our budget in
in one project. Um, another one was our
Stevens Community Center had a $150,000
HVAC unit that somebody decided to go
rip the copper pipe out of it overnight
and that was a $150,000 blow to our
budget. Those are just things that
didn't, you know, we didn't we didn't
plan for. Um, yes, I mentioned, you
know, we get FEMA dollars for the
contracts, we'll get insurance for the
air conditioner, but not any of that
covers all that. Um, and then there's
the other things of just like somebody
went to the ballpark to turn on the
lights and the lights blew up because
they're from 1950 and you know, how do
we how do we budget to replace bulbs
from 1950 when they don't exist? And so
it's just really challenging. So if it
was all, you know, if we were really
budgeted and we had some of our uh
things figured out to that minutia and
we kind of had a regular plan, but every
day it's a new challenge or new problem
or the sewer collapse at Resmond Golf
Center because it's from whatever year
it was and it's 4T deep in front of the
facility and just in plan on that. Yes,
we put money back to have for problems,
but at a certain point it's it's when
you all your facilities are are missing
so much deferred maintenance. It's just
a it's another the pool today was the
pool heater. You know, how much is that?
$20,000 or whatever it is.
>> Well, I remember when you went through
those reports on the community centers
three or four months ago, I think Justin
did, right? And you were talking about I
was over at Dunbar when you guys were
talking about it and you're like, "Oh,
we're spending this, but the engineer
went through and found like what
whatever millions of dollars worth of
stuff that need to be fixed, right?"
Like five million, right, for one
community center. So it's that's all
weighing on me. Like I'm just trying to,
you know, I mean,
>> okay. Well,
>> to answer your question, K, we do do
what you're talking about. It's just
never we never follow our plan because
our plan is always an emergency,
>> right?
>> Okay. Well, we'll just table that until
talk about it next week, next um month
and then decide whether January is a
good date to talk about budget. Okay,
great.
>> Chair,
>> yes.
>> Um you were asking for input about the
agenda and uh one suggestion was about
um the border the presentation that the
parks commission would be um giving to
the board. If y'all wanted to start
discussing that um on when do you want
to put that on the agenda? maybe next
month or
>> um yeah, we'll just put that under uh
you talking about number six on the
agenda. We can move that to unfinished
business maybe. Um
>> I think she's talking Are you talking
about the 13 or you talking about the
presentation that the commission
>> the presentation Thank you. the
presentation that the board give that
the pars commission presents to the
board of directors.
>> Okay. So if y'all want to start
a two or three
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go ahead and let's go
ahead and do that while Ben's still
here. Um, what what uh so can we go
ahead and make that request, Simone?
Didn't you do all that last year when
you made the request or to get on the
agenda?
>> Hot potato.
>> Sorry. Um, so you guys, we just uh I
think Leland worked to get that on the
agenda with the um board of directors.
However, you guys spent several months
working on it and so I think the
suggestion is to let's go ahead and get
started because when we started in the
spring it was like ah we forgot all the
stuff we did in 2024. So if we start in
2025 then we'll have it all fresh in our
brain.
>> Okay, perfect. So um I guess we can
start with everybody bringing a a list
or some kind of item to put on the
PowerPoint. If I could, I think what
we're proposing is to put it as an
agenda item for next month and then we
can talk about what needs to go happen
after that.
>> Okay.
>> And start putting together a timeline so
we can assemble a presentation and then
present it to the board of directors.
>> Perfect.
>> Got all that. Okay.
>> And um it was Simone's idea.
>> Okay. Well, thank you Simone. We
appreciate it.
>> Can I ask this? So, is there a way that
it would it be helpful if Graham or
somebody presented what we just showed
the last years with kind of a blank
subject matter to give it so we're not
starting from scratch
>> the template? Yeah, you just leave that.
>> I It's been not working. I'm sorry. Um I
think that'd be a great idea. uh that
way it's like a presentation and the
same time that you would spend on that
presentation you can use for your
discussion to really like figure out
what you want so you're making the best
use of your time. So I think working
with Graham to have the list and you
guys being like yes I love that one and
let's get more pictures of that event
and really pull it out for what you want
to actually present to the board in the
spring.
>> That'd be great.
>> That's perfect. And Graham, is that okay
with you? Do you have the presentation
from last year?
>> Yes, I have a copy of it.
>> Okay, great. So you can go ahead and
start working on that, you think?
Can you send us the copy? Like I think
it's probably in my buried in my email
maybe somewhere still
>> of last year's.
>> Yeah, if we can get that.
>> He sent it to everybody.
>> Yeah, that'd be great.
>> Okay, awesome. Thank you. Okay, let's
keep moving along. Thanks, uh, Mahogany.
Um, new commissioner subcommittee
assignments. We already discussed that.
Commissioner retreat. Um, have we have
you settled on any dates on that? So,
>> that's a January goal, possibly
February. the holidays are going on
right now. It's hard to get people
together.
>> Okay. So, let's um let's go ahead and
leave that on unfinished business for
next month. But let's bring if you could
bring a couple dates um and then maybe
in January, February, you know, for the
December meeting, then we can discuss
those then.
>> No problem.
>> Great. Um parks commission site visit
number three, Bo Park Pavilion. That was
last
um month and we did that. Um it was
great. Uh I was gonna say that's the
pictures we need, right? Of of
whiteside. See that?
>> Yes. It actually uh
>> the pictures and the video.
>> Yes. Of us. Leland was kind enough for
people who didn't make it to bring a
bicycle and we rode the little bicycle
course um out there and it actually
inspired me to buy a bicycle. So I
appreciate that. Um maybe start riding
um some mountain mountain bike trails.
So thank you for that. Thanks for
everybody who showed up.
Um, anybody else have any comments on
that?
All right. Hearing none, let's um let's
let's jump. We we finished unfinished
business. Let's go back. It's my
understanding there's a citizen here
that would like to say something. Is
that correct? Okay, great. If you want
to come up to the uh podium here, um I
think we limit these to typically around
five minutes or less. So, if you um if
you can keep it within that, we'd really
appreciate it.
>> All right. Good afternoon. My name is
Katherine Noak and um I'm just honored
and pleased to be here. It's actually
one of my first um town city hall
meetings where I've came. Um I'm
originally from Jupiter, Florida and uh
I decided to take a road trip to uh the
east coast to the west coast. Um, I'm
doing that because I want to understand
what our nation is really needing and
what we're lacking um on all different
kinds of levels, whether it's our
infrastructure, our parks and
recreations, or our community. Um, I
think often times that we see a lot of
other things and noise out there, but we
forget to really tap into um each one of
us or just taking that road trip, that
journey of life. Um, so I just left on
October 31st on on Halloween and I said,
um, I'm an artist, a doll. Uh, so I had
my little mustache on and it had a
costume and it said the weaver of the
universe. So jumped in my car and
decided I might go like Forest Gumpet a
little bit. Um, and see if I could show
uh not proof of concept, but proof of
community. And uh I would meet fellow
people along my trip that were doing
things for um our nation and to bring
back uh infrastructures and community as
well as education and the pillars of
what makes a society run. Um so here I
am. Uh, I went from, uh, Georgia and
stopped in Tennessee and then, uh, now
I'm in Arkansas and I'm, uh, I'm looking
to find out how I can serve all of you
here and my, um, partnerships that I've
acquired through my 40 years of life
would be able to help facilitate. Um, I
do work with art platforms and
technology. Um, I'm very much so into
using tech for the betterment of
humanity. Um, a lot of times we're
pushing things out so fast that we
forget that we're not really maybe doing
some of the proper ways to do it. So,
I'm very much an engineer mind reverse
psychology things. Um, so uh I'm working
currently on the myth which is the most
important planetary plans and uh after
hearing what you guys are doing I think
it could possibly potentially help. It
is a 3D spherical map that would be more
efficient with every department that
you're using. Um it's kind of nodes that
you'd put in some information. Um I can
show it to you all later and you know
anyway again I could be of service. And
then on your community aspect I think
that it's about arts and storytelling
and your community events um that you're
discussing and even social media. Um, so
we do have some uh ways that we can help
maybe some artists do some murals, which
I've seen in the town already that you
have some great art pieces and um we can
fractionalize it and give it back to the
budgets that you're needing some funds
for and say, "Okay, well, hey, we might
need this um with the electric or even
maybe um when you have certain things
like the 1950s light bulbs, um we do
have like quantum applied mechanics
engineers. So maybe we can put like this
thing where it's like, "Hey, there's a
competition to find out what this new
tech is that would actually help and do
regenerative practices." So, um, just
stuff like that. And you know, again,
I'm I'm here. My name is Katherine Noak.
I'm kind of like the catalyst, uh, to
help and be of service.
>> Well, great. Well, thank you so much for
coming today. We really appreciate it.
>> Thank you. Thank you. And I'll be at the
ribbon cutting ceremony, too, now.
>> Yeah. Oh,
>> like to ask questions.
>> Okay. Oh, does anybody have any
questions for Miss Novette?
>> Is that fair? Yeah. Uh, what's the most
important or interesting thing that you
can share that you've seen on your
travels to date?
>> Um, you know, I feel like I changed my
environment and since I've changed my
environment in Florida, uh, that's
sometimes all we need is to go outside
and look. So, sometimes we're just
thinking it's right there and the
problem's right there, but you got to go
micro, macro, and then back in overall.
So, I think just walking into this
building and how everybody was like,
"Hi, how are you?" And just so um
helpful was just such it made my heart
like full. So, I knew I was in the right
spot and this little rock is going to
definitely put a like a stamp on my
heart. So, I'm grateful for that.
>> Awesome. Thank you so much.
>> Thank you for sharing your story.
>> All right, let's move on to new
business. Um looks like this was
chairman France was wanted to talk more
about the parks commission golf
tournament. Has anyone talked to
Chairman France about this?
All right, hearing none, we'll move on
and wait to hear from him um later on.
Uh next we have the parks feature
directory update. Um
Graham, is that you? Do you know
anything about that?
Weren't we waiting until like January or
something for this or
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, the update last month
was that
there is no update really, but the the
city leadership let us know that they're
still looking to migrate the website um
platform and that should be they said
complete this month. Um so, we're not
supposed to make any major updates to
the website until that happens. And so,
um, this I think the I mean, we've
talked to Commissioner Bernardo about
the parks features a lot and we've built
out what we'd like that to look at look
like as far as like um the wording of
the website. We've written all that out
and we've come up with the structure. We
just have to actually implement it on
the new website and that's not something
we can do on the current website. So,
>> so, so it sounds to me like what you're
saying is that next month you should
have an update that the the city has
transferred all their things and we'll
be able to get started. Is that what
we're hoping?
>> That is the hope.
>> Okay.
>> Is it possible to see what you guys have
what you're envisioning
>> um
>> before it actually goes website?
>> Not really. As far as a design like I I
can't really show you what it would look
like on a new website because we don't
know what the design will be for the new
site. I can tell you the groupings of
things like um basically what we have so
far is um if you want to play tennis,
this is the list of parks. If you want
to play pickle ball, this is the list of
parks. And we have it broken out like
that and we've looked at our inventory.
Um but I don't have
a design. So, in concept, it'd be like a
features page that would list all the
different activities the parks offer,
and then from there, you could click and
expand and it would tell you which parks
offer those specific
>> Yes.
>> features.
>> It could be um different tiles of
features or it could be a sidebar where
you can click different boxes like if
you want to show all the parks that have
pickle ball and basketball, then it
>> So, it has some filters. Okay. It just
depends on the functionality of the new
website.
>> Okay. Thank you.
>> Yeah, I like that. That sounds great.
>> The the city as a whole operates the
website, right? And we just live within
the city website. So Graham and I, we
don't want to change anything until the
city website. We We don't know what
we're going to live in yet. So he's
building out the data.
>> That's what I was looking for
functionally. What was it going to do?
But we just don't know how functional it
will be until we actually get the new
house to live in.
>> And and who's the who would be like the
person that's in charge? I mean,
obviously, you know, website.
>> Yeah. But the the
>> uh Well, there's a whole series of
people, but
>> is there like a department?
>> Yeah, Graham. Who is the
>> It's the IT department. And yeah,
Caitlyn is who I've been talking to, but
we're also working with a vendor. I'm
not sure who that vendor is, but it's
not all a lot of the work isn't being
done internally.
Great. Okay. Great. Anything Anybody
else have any questions about that?
All right. Great. Uh the next one is the
2026 meetings event schedule for parks
commission. So, everyone should have
received a list of all the meetings for
next year. Um please put these on your
calendar. Um the faster they get on your
calendar, the more likely you are to
attend. So, thank you.
>> Um well, I did put it on there for dis
for review. So, there are a couple of
dates on there.
>> Sorry, a couple of dates on there on the
list that um there's some conflicts and
so it's one of those things we'll review
now and see if you want to keep that
date that it has been suggested to move
to.
Do we need to vote on this now or are we
um We do.
>> You would need to vote by the end of the
year. So, you could vote December if you
wanted to.
>> Okay. Why Why don't everybody take a a
second to look at this um at home, you
know, when you're there and then if you
have any conflict, you can come back and
talk about it next week. But I mean, my
plan's just to move forward with this as
written. But let's let's definitely talk
about it next month. So, we'll table
that.
All right. Anybody have any other agenda
items they want to add for next meeting?
All right. Hearing none. Um, let's move
on to the board liaison feedback.
Director Lewis or Director Peek.
>> Just want to say thanks again to Parks
and Recre as well as community programs
for the wonderful event we had uh last
Saturday, the third annual award 6 block
party and it was kicking it at Kanis
Park. So just very appreciative. A lot
of people came out. It was wellreceived
and just looking forward to next year.
>> You were there.
>> Yeah. Oh yeah. I had a blast. It was it
was a lot of fun. I mean there was there
they had a stage, they had food, they
had pickle a lot of people playing
pickle ball like the whole time and so
it was it was a really good event. I was
really glad I came.
>> Oh, I do have a question about Stevens
though.
I'm getting feedback community too. So,
if we could get them open ASAP, Stevens
Community Center. Is there a
projected date?
No.
>> Justin, would you would you address
Stephen
give as much detail in terms of what's
what's the challenge and everything?
>> Um, yeah, I don't have an exact date on
that. I can go like try to get an update
like right now. But, uh, it's with there
was there were some issues with the
parts and some stuff for the fire
marshals, some code for the fire thing.
So, everything's done and we're ready to
like open it, but we can't open it until
that last box is checked and they get on
their schedule. And he may be on their
schedule, but I'm not sure how far out
they scheduled to to do that. So, I can
find out. And if that's the holdup is
just literally getting them out, then we
might could use some some assistance
with maybe bumping that up. But, that's
all that's waiting on. So,
>> we know who to call. Yeah.
>> So,
>> just another some people.
>> Let me make sure that the parts came in
>> and that that's all it's waiting on, but
that's we're we're right there.
>> Perfect.
>> Yeah. The parts that he was referring to
is there was some kind of sensor or
something like that. And I don't want to
say the wrong thing, but there was a
sensor that's supposed to be an air duct
or something that was missing or
something like that. So, we had to get
that sensor. And there's always a delay
in terms of getting sensors and stuff
like that from technological groups
today. So, but
>> okay, I'm going to say some things.
>> Okay,
>> they may be appropriate. They may
they're not inappropriate. Uh but just
just from my perspective and as I have
been the liaison to this commission for
nine years, so I've seen a lot of people
roll on and roll off and I'm not saying
the budget is not important. It is very
important, but ultimately it's it's it's
we're going to have to hash things out
on the board level. I'm not saying that
you all can't have input, but I don't
want to get too distracted and bogged
down on the budget. It it it's it's
going to be what it's going to be, and
parks will not have enough until we
successfully pass the sales tax. With
that being said, I think there's so many
positive things we can do, you all can
do as parks commissioners. I have one
idea. If if you if each of you would
adopt a park or or a playground in your
ward near your house or where you work
and really rally people to take care of
it, we we need help. We need volunteers.
Karen's right here. I mean, if it's a
adopting a trail, a pocket park, a big
park, a flower bed, uh we need community
help. It's it's going to take everybody
to um address these needs because of the
tremendous amount of deferred
maintenance. So I I am challenging each
of you to adopt something in our park
system as your personal project and then
to work on getting volunteers to help
you fulfill needs and we know what the
needs are. Is that too much to ask?
Yeah.
>> I mean, I mean, Summer, you you're
you've adopted a street, the salon. I
mean, you're you're doing all the right
things, but I think that it's important
showing up here and doing the work, but
I think uh and again, this this is this
is just me, but it is going to take a
village. And knowing knowing the stress
that Leland and everybody else in this
department's in, uh let's not obsess
about the numbers because the numbers
are not going to be pretty. We're not
going to be able to have everything that
we need again until he passes sales tax.
So, I'm I'm begging you to volunteer and
adopt Park.
>> Glad you said that because for the uh
Kanes Park, we have a resident who has
stepped up and volunteered to clean the
bathrooms. He has a cleaning services
service. So, so glad you brought that
up. So, thanks to Mr. Bryant for
offering your services.
>> Yes, I agree. Thank you. And thank you,
Director Lewis, for getting us there. Um
well, you know that um going back, let's
go back to number six on presentations.
I guess this may be for next week. Um
could if if you feel like it's that
important, Director Peek, should we
maybe have could Karen talk about some
ways that we could volunteer next week
or get our friends involved and maybe
you could highlight a few parks that no
one has volunteered for to adopt and
some some streets around the park. Is
that kind of what your idea was? Well,
not not really because but but
everybody's comments today. I'm
>> sound like I'm at home and and she she
could use all the volunteers she could
get. But what I'll give you an example.
Uh so I live kind of Midtown West. Uh we
have a new playground at Panky. Uh it
was very wellreceived. I had people who
lived a couple of miles from there that
used the park to ask how they could help
maintain it. and it's pretty easy to
maintain. So people from my neighborhood
in Piedmont have volunteered to once a
week to go to Panky to pick up trash in
that park and to make sure that
everything was copathetic. So I that
that's that's the kind of thing whether
it's through your HOA or your POA or
just people that live on your street, a
a park nearby or a park in another part
of the city that needs some TLC. Um that
that's the kind of thing I'm thinking of
>> and volunteers do need to come
>> because when you go out and you make
sure the park's available.
>> Well, I I didn't go through you and I'm
doing okay. I mean I just Yeah, I but I
they're they're picking up trash so I I
didn't know I needed to go through you.
I didn't do that.
>> Well, our policy is that we want all
volunteers to come through the
appropriate person. So in parks it's me.
In streets it's Lenny and Ray. at the
zoo, it's their staff because we have
people out there reserving our parks
that are we consider contracts. So, we
just want to make sure they're not being
bothered and disturbed when they're out
there.
>> So, I guess and and look, uh, Director
Peg, correct me if I'm wrong, but could
you get I mean, I just don't know. You
don't even know where to start, you
know, and I think if you were able to to
maybe lay out some things that we could
um where we could get involved or
volunteer or get our friends involved, I
think that would be more beneficial to
what you're saying as well. And if
there's certain kind of parks that we
can know where to volunteer, that might
be a good thing.
>> Absolutely. And we track all our hours.
We track all our data, whether it's in
parks, our streets, or anything. So that
we know if these programs are successful
or not. So without turning in that data,
we don't really know where we're stand.
We don't know if it's growing or if it's
stagnant or even if it's declining.
>> So the more hours you turn in and get to
us, then we know we're been successful.
>> I have a followup since you're up here,
Karen. got into this. Um, can you
explain what we maybe this is for say
for another day, but I know for all of
our volunteers in programs or in
facilities, they all have to go through
a background check. Do all volunteers
that say, you know, Cappy has somebody
picking up trash at a park. Where
where's the is there a line in that or
are we are we doing them all or what?
So background checks are reserved for
those who deal with a vulnerable
population such as children, uh,
elderly, special needs that. So in our
community centers, yes, you do because
you're there on site, there's a bathroom
there, um, that you're sharing with
kids, but in a park, it's more of an
open space. So those do not have to go
through background checks.
Sure.
I understand the cleaning. Does he need
to back?
>> He has called me on the phone.
>> Yes.
>> Not yet, but we're we're working on it.
>> He will be though. He will be. All of
our staff here are very aware that when
there's a volunteer opportunity, we move
that person over to care and to help or
like in operations, the individual that
wants to help clean the restroom at
Kanes, we'll still work with operations
and maintenance in terms of what you
know challenges might be or you know
help and certain things like that. But
in terms of working from a volunteer
standpoint, they're coordinated through
parent socks.
>> Okay. He called me this weekend when I
was busy with Capitol Con, so I got to
talk to him for a a minute. But yes, we
were on the same page. Not a problem.
>> And then can we uh can you work with
Graham to maybe get our social media to
where people can learn about volunteer?
I you do a great job already and I see
it all the time, but just continue to
keep doing that to make sure everybody
knows where they can volunteer and good
opportunities to do that.
>> Absolutely. And also in your packet
there are um just kind of the basics are
outlined,
but I can get more in depth with y'all
at a different time.
>> That'd be great. Thank you.
>> All right. Does anybody have anything
else they'd like to add?
>> All right. It is 12:58. Um so it looks
like uh I do need a motion to end the
meeting. Is there a motion to end the
meeting?
>> I'll make that motion.
>> Is there a second?
>> Second. Anyone opposed?
Hearing none, uh motion passes and the
meeting is adjourned. Thank you.
>> Talk about budget. I just I mean that's
just to me a budget is like
>> part of your goals, right? Like what you
I know it's different in government
budgeting than it is for for private
industry budgeting, but you know, one of
>> those committee meetings Sh over.
