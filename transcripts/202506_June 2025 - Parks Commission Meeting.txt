by Simone. So, can I get a motion?
Make that motion. I'll second it. All in

I'll make that motion.
Second.
Okay.
Do we have any citizen communication?
Any citizens online or here? I don't see
any.
Okay. Um in your packets you have uh of
course as you have every month you have
the uh staff reports
and um I'll turn it over to Leland if he
has any comments but if after Leland
speaks if you have any questions on
staff just on the staff reports just
let's wait until after Leland speaks.
Thank you.
So just to be clear you're holding
questions for staff until after your
speak. Okay. Sure.
So, I'll go into mine. So, staff reports
and then I was just going to say if
anybody had any questions for staff
reports, please let us know. Um staff's
here to answer those questions. Um I
would like to go over the board agenda
real quick. Um those of these are u the
point of this is to cover items that the
department is working on, has worked on,
what's been approved, what's not
approved. currently at the agenda. The
most recent that we just had uh this
past Tuesday night was resin 13 uh golf
course uh for the permits. Um so we have
spent money on resin golf course prior
to this for construction and planning to
uh fix a erosion issue on hole 13. Uh
just being brief here, we're now doing
another um
per permit process here that cost
significant amount of money to have the
consultants do for us. Um another one is
our mowing contracts. We mow roughly 30
parks with contract uh labor. We have uh
three different contracts uh for those
mowing uh contractors. And so we uh have
to come back to the board every year and
and ask for the extension of existing
contracts.
So that's what that is for. And we'll be
um rebidding those contracts, I believe,
next year. Um moving forward, we also
have a Cromwell contract. This is to
help us with some u planning efforts uh
for asset inventory, also ADA transition
plan. And um a lot of this will help us
with our going forward process of
accreditation. Um and there's much more
to come on that. So those are some
recent ones. I'd also like to share that
our senior facility uh contract was just
fully executed by our city attorney's
office. So we did have a successful bid
on that. That's at the center of the
university park and Flynno was the
contractor and now we're waiting for
Flynn Co to give us a schedule and then
we'll start to issue a notice to
proceed. So, that's an exciting big um
project for us was awarded around $4.1
million project. Um many other things I
know I was not able to make it to the
last meeting. So, if there are any
questions about the previous board
agenda, happy to go back into that or
anything for the future and staff can
cover that as well. Um, I would like to
introduce um Gabby is our new um, if you
would stand up just for a second is our
new parks communication and social media
specialist. She will be working uh,
directly with Graham Brown who is also
uh, one of our new employees, but you've
already had a chance to meet him. Um,
Gabby, would you like to say any a few
words about your uh history or your past
or um what what's your position here in
in Little Rock Par?
Yeah. Well, good afternoon everyone. I'm
Gabby Pervvis and I'm just so honored to
serve as the communications in social
media specialist for Parks and Recre. Um
my role covers wide range of areas. It's
going to be social media obviously, and
then digital and print marketing, um
event promotion, website management,
branding, and community outreach. And
over the past month and a half, um I've
been focused on aligning our
communications with more of a strategic
consistent approach both online and in
person. Um this includes improving how
we promote our programs, elevating our
website experience in the future, and
using data to guide like what content
we're putting out. um from day camps,
sports leagues to park upgrades,
community events, everything that we
share, I'm trying to um tell a story
while doing it. Um my strategy moving
forward is to just making sure our
messaging is very clear and visually
strong and tied to what matters most to
our audience and our community. Um so
yeah, that's pretty much it. Thank you
for giving me the opportunity to speak
and I'm always open to like ideas and
collaboration and I'm excited to work
with the marketing subcommittee to help
amplify the great work that we've been
doing so far.
So much so I'd like to thank you and
thank you for your help so far. Uh if
you're not following us on Facebook, I'm
sure all of y'all are, but if you're
not, please do. Um there's been some uh
great new posts on our social media. Um
I believe they're all Gabby's and and
some maybe from Graham. But as a team
effort, we've had some great uh our
social media continues to grow. Um would
like to share that um when I started as
director, I think we had about 6,000
followers and because of different um
staff members working on this and having
directed staff towards social media,
we've been able to grow that now to just
over 12,000. So, um, which is was great
for us to be able to tell our story and
get the information out there and and we
answer questions
directly on it constantly. So, um,
anyway, that's that's my director's
report. I'm there's many many things we
could discuss. So, if there's any
questions for me, please let me know or
for, uh, staff. Uh, Leland. Yes. Make a
quick quick comment about the social
media. your post are great and I
encourage all the commissioners to
encourage your friends to follow parks.
Uh I really like the one about the
progress at reservoir that that was
fantastic. Uh so keep up the good work.
It's it's it's got an impact and Graham,
you too. Good team. So good hires,
Leland.
Thank you, Kathy.
I I would like to say there's not
anybody on here for events, but if
there's any particular events, I know we
have some um ribbon cutings coming up
and everything, but our dates are not
would we say 100%. So, don't think we
have anything to share, but look forward
to some uh there's a ribbon cutting
coming for West Central Sports Complex,
which is a great project. Um and then I
don't know if we're going to have what
kind of groundbreaking we might have for
the center. uh for the senior facility.
So those are some upcoming events. But
um anyway, any questions? Has that been
shared yet? Which one? The West Central.
No, that's what I was saying. We haven't
shared the date. Uh but it's July 15th.
Or is it not set in stone? I'm sorry.
We're not sharing that yet. Okay. Or I
mean, we don't have anything to
publicize about it yet. So I wasn't
going to share it until we were ready to
publicize it.
Yeah, if you could share it once y'all
have everything figured out, we'd love
to send that to the commissioners and of
course the the directors. We're just
trying to that's that's the date. That's
what we're trying to confirm. But we
want to make a flyer and we want to make
sure all of our vendors that we're
trying to have all commit to that date
um and so that we can make sure we have
successful everybody being there. So, we
we had a great meeting yesterday. I
think it's all in its final stages. It's
just those little details but to make
sure it's a it's a great idea and in my
mind it was a lot sooner than what it
is. So disregard. Okay. Yeah. It's about
a month out or so. Yeah. Yeah. That's
next month.
I would like to say this while we're
sitting here. Um
I I would like to say thank you for Ben
coming and giving a presentation to the
board. Um, I know that was some time
ago, but I was able to speak to it. And
so, um, I think it was a good
presentation and it was the first time
that I'm aware of it from a, um,
commission giving an annual report and,
um, just sharing more information to the
board to, um, inform them on what we're
doing or not doing. And so, appreciate
Ben and and the commissioners here for
supporting Ben in that role.
Um, any other there is one bullet point
about uh I think that was talked about
last week. So if you're at a for our
commissioners or anyone I guess if
you're at a a park and want to take a
picture um please send those pictures to
Graham or Gabby I guess. Um
because I think it's just built up on
the momentum we have with social media
and the amount of followers we have. So,
just remember that commissioners, if
you're at a park, uh please remember to
take a picture and send it to um Graham
and Gabby. So,
anything else uh on uh item number five
before we move move down the list?
Um I don't think we have any
presentations today. Um so, we'll move
past that. Unfinished business. Um, we
have three subcommittees and I'm going
to start with um with marketing and and
Quinton, you can if you can actually say
who's on your committee because I think
we've kind of I forgotten Elise and um
go go and talk about any update you have
please. Uh yes, uh Commissioner Woods is
on my is on the committee. Okay, I
believe that's all. Is that right? Okay.
So, we powerful committee of two. Um,
unfortunately we weren't able to meet
this month, but we do plan on meeting
next month. Um, you know, we're going to
talk with Gabby. Uh, we're letting her
get settled in. Um, but, uh, sounds like
she's got some fantastic ideas, so I
look forward to to working with her.
Okay.
And then we have master plan
subcommittee. I know that's JT,
Mike, and Fletcher, I think. Yeah.
Canon. Um, I don't know if y'all met
today. Not sure if y'all did. Um but any
updates for you guys on that? We didn't
have a quorum today.
Okay. Or any comments just for the go
the order. Um just in general we're
trying to do some investigation on what
the process is to dispose of any parks
lands if we found any that we thought
were not useful. So that's a very
general statement and uh we're just kind
of doing some research to understand
that process in case we want to use it.
Okay.
Um and parts conservancy um um I know
it's myself and Sam. I don't know anyone
else on conser and you Okay, that's
right. I uh I had a conversation with
Mike Ingram who has went red some golf.
I know in the past, we didn't do it last
year, but we would hold a golf
tournament um every year that that
supported the um summer playground
program, and we didn't do it last year
because a previous commission kind of
ran with it. And um we're we're
discussing dates about maybe potentially
doing it later this summer. Um I just
need to get back with Mike Ingram on
that um to maybe do to to pick this up
and make it a good event. But this
is is a parks conservancy event because
all the money will be go will go through
parks conservancy because it's a
nonprofit but it will go to helping
uh pay for
um pay for events uh for summer
playground program. So
I need to get with Mike Ingram on that.
So just a FYI on that.
Okay. Um, so that was subcommittee
report commission ideas goals. I think
we've kind of already talked about that
and one of those goals was these
not corly but three times a year site
visits. Um, we had our first one in
April at the Hersa Museum of Fine Arts
in the MacArthur Park. I thought it went
really well. And our next one's going to
be July 10th at the West Central Ball
Field. Um, I've never been to this to
this park and I I really want to go. So,
that's why we scheduled it here is for
some of us to get more familiar with
this. And I'm just I don't know the area
of it. So, I'm just open up to maybe
some ideas on do we just want to do just
a tour of it? Do we do anything
afterward or we just want just start at
four and do a tour? I'm open to ideas
about our next one on July 10th.
Do
you guys just want to do a tour of it?
Yeah, tour is fine. All right. Yeah,
we'll start at 400 p.m. It's going to be
pretty hot, so I'm sure we'll we'll stay
indoors and just just take it check it
out. So, like to make a small suggestion
is you said West Central, right? Yeah.
So, you're right. It will be hot, but I
I think it'd be a great time to
experience um our um ball field that we
have just recently have just completed.
So, if we could start out there, maybe
there's a little opportunity to do
something fun there just briefly and
then head indoors to the community
center and review the community center
and you know that just giving you a
little bit of an agenda to to cover
there. Um, but you know, because we'll
be doing the uh ribbon cutting hopefully
just shortly after that, about a week
after that. So, um, and I'll I'll bring
a ice chest, some waters and coats and
stuff if we want to just have some
drinks while we walk around. Just Sure.
Um, where where is that? It's at the
corner of John Barrow and Colonel Glenn.
8616.
If you put it in a map 8616 Colonel
Queens,
it it's impressive. It's our newest and
nicest community center by by far. The
community center was completed in
approximately 2016.
Um so it's it is a nicer community
center. Um there was always originally a
plan to um build something else there, a
pool. I know that's Don't say that.
Um but anyway, so and the ball field
complex um was there originally and it's
been there from maybe the 50s or 60s. Um
there's a lot of history there to that
ball field complex. And so just recently
we've uh spent $1.3 million on building
a new field. So, we were going to
replace uh or upgrade some of the fields
and decided that the fields are to the
point to where we thought it'd be best
to build one new one. And so, that's
what we have out there. And it's going
to create a new standard for us for our
complex. So, we have one really nice one
and some from the 1950s. Um it's a
really interesting, you know, kind of
scenario there to to look at one new one
and some old ones. Um with the backdrop
of our nice community center. So, a lot
of great things to conversate about
there and um we can have our some of our
staff there to um inform also on, you
know, what our programming and different
aspects are there. Cool. Well, hope
everyone can be there. Uh I'm excited
just to go check it out. So,
uh sorry, excuse me. Just a reminder, I
have to remind you, no discussing
business, please. Just We would never.
Thank you. I know you wouldn't.
Um, I unfortunately was not able to make
it on May 21st. I was out of town, but I
would love to see how it went, how much
money was raised. I don't know if that's
Leland or Cathy. Um, how'd it go? Uh, it
went really well. I think we were all uh
surprised at the number of people that
turned out. Um, we're still getting
checks. I don't know what the current
tally is because that Do you know in the
conservancy fund? I do not know the
conservancy, but I do know that we um
first of all, I want to say thank you to
Cappy, but the the biggest um thank you
to is also to our marathon division gave
us a significant check for the project.
Um there were some other um things that
might be coming out of the works of that
of that um gathering. So, I would just
like to share that it just shows how
important it is to get together and have
some of those fundraising events and
really it might be something that comes
after the fact that might be something
bigger. Um, you never really know and
appreciate everybody that did come and
was a part of the event and and donated
to the to the great project. Yeah. And
Summer, thank you for being there. Um,
and we we had people from all over the
community, not just people that just
live near the park. And uh the woman who
gave me the idea to do this uh was not
able to attend, but she sent me a text a
few days ago and uh because her
neighbors were I I credited her and one
of her neighbors and she'll be sending a
big check. I haven't gotten that check
yet, but she sent me a text. She said,
"What do you think about a neighborhood
challenge? The surrounding
neighborhoods." So I said, "If you can
help or organize that, I can help you.
Especially if you if you know where
Reservoir is, it it's practically in
Leewood, but all of those neighborhoods
across the street, River Ridge,
Foxcraftoft, Robinwood, they all use
that and people from all over the city
use the park. So, I think that's going
to be the next step, a neighborhood
challenge. And then I don't want to jinx
myself, but I have a very important
meeting on Friday, and I'm I have a big
ask, and pray for me. Uh, and it would
be it would be considerable regarding
reservoir. Mhm. Okay. Uh, so I don't
think it's a a kind of one and done and
we're going to stop, but I do I think we
had about 50 or so people there and uh
the conservancy was very happy with the
attendance. Our our words were brief,
which is a miracle for me, maybe not for
you, but I I thought it was a great
start, but again, it's not just one and
done that. We're going to continue
because it's a what almost a 60 acre
park and we've got a lot of plans. Was
there and maybe this is for Graham. Was
there a lot of online donations to you
the link you created?
I'm sorry.
I don't know if you're tracking that or
not, but uh the conservancy would have
to answer that since there's a link to
their website. So, I don't have a number
on the donations. Gotcha. But there was
a lot of interest online in general. We
got a lot of views and things for
anything pro promoting the event. Okay.
Yeah. a lot of ongoing questions even as
of this morning about what's going on at
Reservoir Park and Cool. So, it's good
social media, too. And if and I I could
uh say one thing because I I would I
want some more of the cards maybe not
the cards that talk about the event uh
obviously, but I have discovered a
pretty good marketing tool. Uh I put
those in the check presenters at Trios
and people take them. I've done it for
the firefighters. have done it for the
pick it up litter campaign, but you
know, we don't take the credit card like
some restaurants do. We actually hand
what we call a check presenter and they
take it. I know it because I restocked
them and because of the proximity of the
restaurant to reservoir, I think that
would just be an ongoing thing to remind
people that we are seeking donations.
Yes. Do you want the same exact one that
Yeah, except Yeah, without the date and
with the with the uh code. I think that
would be So, the conservancy had a lot
of extra ones from the event. Okay. Um
and I'm sure we could get those. Yeah,
I'll just keep loading those up. Okay.
Thank you. And and then Director Peek,
on the neighborhood challenge, are you
going like as far over as the Heights or
are you I mean, because I think that
would be the closest park to That's
where I live. That'd be the closest park
to me. I That's where I would go all the
time. I I I see that whole Canrol
corridor or near that Canrol corridor
even out uh you know I live off San Pek
Road but it it is such a um it's a
central park and it's a big park with it
once had a lot of amenities. We'd like
to have those again but no that's a good
idea to include heights even Hillrest.
Yeah.
Thank you.
So last week or not last week, last
month we voted on the three applications
um plus canon uh to the vacancies you
all approved. Yes. Does it now what has
it been voted on at the city board or do
we know that yet? Okay. We we um it was
on our agenda yesterday to um go into
executive session next week on Tuesday
to appoint people to boards and
commission. Okay. So once they're if
they are appointed
they would start I guess here in July.
They would at the Yeah, they're notified
immediately and then they should be well
I guess not in the July the the August
June. July where are we? It's June.
Yeah. Okay.
I have a question about that. um if
they're voted on at the next uh board
meeting, um that may not give them a
full 30-day notice. Um I'm I'm just
asking, you know, if uh did you want to
possibly look at pushing them out to
August or if they have other
arrangements they have to make? Um
especially with it being the summer with
it being the summer to require them to
be here in July. Um, we may want to look
at pushing them out to August at least.
Uh, just a suggestion.
Okay. I don't know if that's my I don't
know if we make the decision or I don't
know. So, I mean, if they're approved in
June, mid in the 17th of June, you're
saying that you might not want them to
start on July in July. Is that correct?
Right. There may not be enough notice
for them to start in July. Is is the
question whether for them to be able to
attend or to be mandatory to attend?
Well, once they're appointed um then
they're on the clock. So, if they're not
able due to any uh obligations, cruises,
vacations, or anything like that to make
to attend, then out the gate they get an
absence. I see. That's what I thought
you were. So, you know, just to uh you
know, be considerate of that. um you may
want to consider pushing them out to
August.
Are they are they actually approved on
the 17th and they and then that's
because like our resolutions that you
approve usually take like another week
or so before they're signed. Is there a
delay in that process? They're they're
it'll be read into the record on the
17th and usually those people are
notified like the next day. Yeah, I mean
I'm
maybe it's just me, but I mean that's
almost a month um or is a month until
the second Janu or second Wednesday in
July. Um the second Wednesday in July is
July 9th. That's not a month. That's
only three weeks. And um you know, so
okay, maybe that should just be a vote.
Uh with that,
we have a motion to vote on when the new
commissioners start, July or or August.
I'll make the motion to um have them for
the July meeting. Okay, we have a
second. Mike has recommended a motion.
Excuse me. Oh, I just would like us to
take just one second and I'll I'll take
a look. Um just want to check one thing.
Check the bylaws. We'll just come back
to Is that okay, Simone? Can we go down?
Make a motion to table it. Motion to
table.
Second.
Okay. Um the last bullet, I think we've
kind of answered that already. We're
going to continue with doing what we've
always done as far as the vacancy goes.
Um for new commission members,
um
new business. I'm going to I might wait
until we hear from Simone on the first
bullet, but uh do we have an update on
summer playground program? I love to
hear kind of how everything's going
number of people. I don't know if um
Lana, that's you or
Good afternoon. All right.
Okay. So, um we're on week two. We
started June 2nd and um this program
will go through July 24th. Um they're
open Monday through Friday, 7:30 to 6.
Um this is a 8-week program. We have six
locations. Rowine Elementary, Chico
Elementary, West Central Teen C, which
is the teen camp. uh Dumbar Community
Center, East Little Rock, Stevens
Community Center. Um they'll be provided
a lunch and a a breakfast and a lunch uh
daily and they are asked to bring their
own snacks. So, as of Monday, we have uh
205 kids at Dumbar Community Center.
Stevens Community Center, 120. East
Little Rock, 100, West Central, we have
73.
Roman, we have 150 and Chico 150. So, we
have 798 kids signed up in our park
summer day camp. That's awesome. How's
that compared to last year?
Uh, sorry. I have the number. I'm just
curious.
Um, last year we had 587 kids and
uh 798 this year. Awesome. Yeah.
Thank you so much. Any questions on the
playground program?
No. Just kudos to you for getting more
students involved and and keeping them
involved. That's that's good news.
Shana, would you share just briefly the
name change, why, and what how you
started with the uh update at West
Central and how you're using that change
in the program slightly to change the
rest of the program. Okay. So, last year
we did a pilot program at um West
Central Community Center. We called it
youth in action. And so we wanted to
incorporate some different things than
our summer playground program. And so um
this year we changed the name from um
summer playground program to uh park
summer day camp cuz sometimes uh so
people think when we say summer
playground program that the kids are
outside on the playground all day which
they're not. So you know it's a little
hot here in Arkansas. What's it called
again? Excuse me. What's it called
again? Park Summit. Park summer day
camp.
So, we changed the name. We've
restructured uh some of the activities.
We incorporated
um archery, fishing,
um
orientering. They'll be doing camping
101. Uh we've incorporated other things
that was not u originally implemented in
our regular summer playground program.
So, we wanted to provide different
opportunities and experiences for the
kids of little of our of Little Rock. So
we uh Mike Simmons, our outdoor
recreation coordinator, is a part of
this program. He's helping with various
activities. They're doing bike safety.
Uh just having a different experience.
So we just wanted to make it more fun
and and memorable for them to have a
good summer. Good question. Is there any
interest or initiatives in adding like
STEM elements? I understand the
importance of students getting outside.
We we do have a separate program um at
the Southwest Community Center. Um they
have a summer larette program and theirs
is more educational based, STEM based
and all of that. So it sounds like yours
is more outdoor recreation. Thank you
for that. Okay. What? Don't leave
please. Uh so I have a great idea. Uh,
how about maybe not this year, but
incorporating the importance of not
littering and we could get litter kits
out and pick up things and we could
clean up parks and uh I could even get
you curriculum. Keep Little Rock
Beautiful has tons of things especially
for um second, third, and fourth graders
because they teach their parents. But I
would love I mean education's key and
and the litter campaign. I would love to
see you all do something like that and
incorpor I'd even wear my litter costume
and make an appearance. Well, we that
that sounds like fun. We can do that.
Okay, cool. Um, one more question. We
heard Ben talk about earlier about the
golf tournament to raise money for the
summer program. Is there when you were
planning this or as you see the year
going, is there like a like a big need?
I mean, we all want more money, right?
And we all can do a lot more with more
money, but is there something that you
see that's a need that this golf
tournament could help out on that would
that would help with like something
immediate and reasonable? One of the
biggest costs is transportation because
we have to get busing to take the kids
on the various field trips to and from
uh each site that we take them to. So
that's that would be a big help for
that. Yeah. I remember a couple years
ago the the funding from the golf would
go toward field trips or like bring an
ice cream truck. So not it it doesn't
subsidize the cost of going but it it
helps out with activities across the
summer which is in transportation field
trips etc. So right thank you. And we do
plan to incorporate we have a a vendor
to come up with ice cream truck and
different things like that. So exactly
we can use those but the city would pay
for that. Yes. And so we could save the
city money if we raise money for via
private funds.
Yep.
Any more questions? Thank. Okay. Thank
you.
Okay. She might the next one is the
Little Rock Open
update.
[Laughter]
Um the Little Open was was great this
year. Um I think they saw the biggest
crowd that they've ever seen there. Um I
was there to the last day um out there
watching um the finals and it it was a
great opportunity um they had um a a car
set up where you can pick they had balls
inside the car. So that was the
opportunity of somebody to win tickets
to go to USA to watch a wow match and
everything for two people. And so uh the
final count of the balls that was in the
car I think it was uh 1300
and a little over 1300. So everybody had
to every day put in a submission to um
you know get your name chosen for for
those. And so it was it was a good
attraction to for the people to bring
the people to the to the matches. Um
they had a little a few brain delays um
but they were able to work those things
out and um it was just a great great
event. I think we had over 3,000 people
there. So uh kudos to the team that
everybody that helped us out with it. Uh
US and Parker Cadillac. Um, them having
the cars there attracted a lot of people
as well. Um, I saw a lot of cars that I
could probably live in for the cost that
it was it was to purchase them. I'm
like, "Oh my goodness." But anyway, um,
it was a great event,
questions.
Okay.
Yeah. Hey. Yeah. Real quick on the
tournament. I would love for us to
figure out in future years, and I know
the tournament has its own committee,
but I would love to recommend that
we figure out as a city how to promote
this thing.
I mean, it 3,000 people's a ton, but I
mean, you can fit 1,600
easily. probably a thousand, you know,
every day. Um, and it would just be nice
to see the city making a bigger push,
you know, on media, everything else. I
mean, this is
there's a kid that won this two years
ago, won the Australian Open in doubles,
which is one of the four largest
tournaments in the world. Like, these
are not like this isn't single A ball.
this is Triple A like vering on, you
know, they're going to be in the you're
going to see them on TV at the US Open
or Wimbledon or whatever. Um, it's a
great opportunity.
When we talk to the players and their
coaches, they all love the event, love
the there's housing sometimes for them,
great transportation. I mean, it's just
they always get good feedback. So, I
mean, I'd love to see the city keep
promoting it and making it bigger.
Right. Second point, whenever we have
big junior tournaments, sometimes Chip
brings in, you know, four or 500 kids in
a weekend. I would love to figure out
how to set up food trucks like we have
for this tournament. like make it easy
for the families to stay in Little Rock
and stay at the tournament and spend
their dollars in the city
because it's one of the only tennis
facilities that has shade in the
country, right? With all those pine
trees. Like I'm telling you, any other
tournament facility you go in a
multi-state region, they're like Burns
Park and it's a concrete jungle. You
can't like you can't get out of the sun.
And I mean, it's a very unique feature
to Revzman. So, I mean it would be
great. We're already plumbed for
electric to have everything there. It's
just future goals, future things, but
just mentioning it.
I agree. Um and it it the US men's open
did bring um bring in players from all
over the world. Um and and the junior's
tournament that they just had um they
brought in um teams from all the
southern states that deals with the SEC
um sports. So um I do agree with that.
Any questions? Okay. Thank you.
Um before we go on to our next agenda
item, I guess want to get back with
Simone about um
I guess starting time for
uh
the new commissioners. The city
ordinances are silent. Your bylaws are
silent, meaning that there is nothing
official. Um under Robert's rules of
order though, it says that if um that
appointments become effective upon
announcement. Um, so I would say that is
up to you all to decide how you wanted
to move forward.
I think we motion to just be very
democratic and motion to if I can make
one comment. They're always in when we
come out of executive session, they're
always read into the record. I think
they have to that day. Some I'm thinking
they start in July.
Do we need a vote on that or just That
would be the next meeting after next
week. So,
is there anybody that has
a strong feeling that they should that
we shouldn't make it July? I I think
most of people that are coming up, you
know, that apply or they want to be
involved. They want I think they're
ready to go. If they're not, they're
going to miss a meeting. But, you know,
we can I don't think that'll be a
problem for them for the year anyway.
So, with that, are you ready for a
motion?
Yeah. Motion uh for them to start in
July.
And I'll second that. All in favor say
I. I. All opposed.
They will start in July.
Um and I think I guess in July I guess
in new business would be the
subcommittee assignments. Um I guess we
talk about that and see kind of what
their interests are or or maybe we wait
until August so they actually get a feel
for what we're doing. So it might have
made sense for them just to listen and
get acclimated and then maybe in August
they can we actually pick a committee
that they want to be on. It's kind of my
suggestion.
Um I just have a question. So uh for the
upcoming agenda then um for the July
meeting do you just want to put a little
blur introductions from them just learn
about them? Yeah, I think I think well I
think in the subcommittee reports that
they give out so Quinton and Park
Conservancy they can just maybe give a
brief introduction of what they do and
so they can learn about it and then um
it can just be an unfinished business
under subcommittee reports.
Okay.
I think we we do we do set some time in
the agenda for them to maybe just give
give a introduction to them. So,
um, anything else before we head I guess
we're kind of talking about agenda items
from next meeting. So, any agenda items
from next meeting besides you know what
I just talked about.
I have one comment. Go ahead. on
presentations. I think I would I would
like to encourage the um commission here
to always have a presentation and if
there's not one that is we we
established that I believe because we at
one point had a lot of citizen
communication and they wanted to do
presentations so we made it a little bit
of more formal area but if there's not
actually a citizen request that we have
I just generated a quick five different
items that staff could report out on and
I think it'll be an opportunity that we
should just always fill in if there's
not a citizen communication presentation
type item that the pres the commission
should just vote on or pick a item to
have staff come and present on
maybe for July just to maybe each for
the presentation maybe each staff member
can kind of tell what they do since we
have some new employees and we can build
off that in August. What? No, I was just
giggling because it's 130 employees and
so No, I mean the normal people who come
here, the the directors. Oh, just sure.
Yeah. And let me throw let me throw out
just a couple other wild ideas, too. So,
um I just we get a ton of questions,
let's say, about maintenance. I think
it'd be great if we shared some of what
our maintenance crew challenges, pros,
cons.
Um we also have some big projects. the
I30 crossing master plan, the Heineman
master plan for the park. Those are some
other ma we could give an update on
master plans of parks. We also are just
now finishing uh $2 million renovation
to our community centers and just a
quick I mean this is a two-minute
conversation just about what what have
we accomplished in our community
centers? Um our golf updates. Um just
where do we stand in golf? Are we good,
bad? you know, the um staffing there,
everything. Um Mike Simmons, our outdoor
recreation coordinator, is is um having
tons of different popup and events, I
think, to for him to be able to share a
little bit. And um and then our gym
daily fitness center. Um, we have an
advisory group there and our staff there
are always pressed at at doing so many
things there and just sharing a little
bit about that facility and and what
it's the the good aspects of it and the
challenges. Um, so those are just some
that I thought about real quickly. Um,
and then Leland, on that note, um, could
we have, you know, I didn't know there
was a a separate Little Rock open
subcommittee, you know, or some kind of
committee that does that. Could we have
them come and talk and say, "Hey, this
is what went well for us this time. this
is what went poorly. This is what we
think this body could help out with and
this is not what they could help out
with. Same for like the marathon.
Remember we had somebody come and talk
with us two years ago I think for the
marathon. It was awesome. That guy was
fantastic, you know, to talk. So I think
some of those committees that are
working on specific events would be very
helpful for this committee to know about
those and with people on this committee
could use their connections to help in
in other ways that people might not
think about. I agree 100%.
So thank you. So, so how do we get these
people on? Do we just email Ben or do we
I mean about ideas that like I'm sure
everybody here has an idea of somebody
they want to come to us if we had a list
we could just work our way through it
and it could be timely based on events
that are going like golf would be a
great one to have right now right in
this peak golf season I would think. Um
uh but you know you know just for
example so we could make an example list
staff could you know we could put
together a list but realistically I just
said all that just to encourage exactly
what you just said. Okay. So it's just
from y'all's understanding of what we do
and not do and and you know inviting
people up here. So I mean you you took
it to a next level of having you know
the Little Rock Open Committee come and
speak. I think that's a great idea. Um,
but I just think we just need to put
that out as a a request and then we can
see if we can fulfill it or not based on
scheduling and everything else. Perfect.
Thank you. Just for clarification, if
you um have ideas, if you would please
send them to staff, Mahogany would
appreciate it. That way we're not
communicating via email about possible
issues or things that we're going to
discuss later. and I can come up with a
list and we'll give it send them out
every meeting and y'all um discuss in
the next meeting from the list. You just
pick what presentation for the next
meeting.
So that being said, is there a goal for
next meeting?
So, so for me, I think what would be
helpful if you guys are very adept at
your calendar year. So, kind of
piggybacking off of Quincon and I think
what Canon was recommending if we could
get on the front end of things to
provide expertise. I'm sure the reasons
a lot of us got on this board. I think
that'll help us be more valuable to you
guys and then um that'll just help us be
more prepared in these meetings outside
of I think we get things as after it was
executed versus a little bit earlier.
So I will send my recommendations to you
mahogany. Okay, sounds good.
Okay. Is there one one on your list that
you think we should Is there one on your
list that you think we should do for
just go ahead and put on the schedule
for July? You listed Yeah. I mean, I
like everybody's comments, so I think
it's relevant to understand that maybe
there's something coming up. I was
trying to think like what's the next big
event that or item or project or
something, but there's so many that um
like it be the senior facility or
something like that, but we've presented
some on that. So, um, golf is a good
one. It's, um, these these different
master plan projects I was talking
about. Um,
I think we should start with the basics
and do maintenance. Okay. I agree with
that. Second. Okay. Let's do maintenance
for
next month.
That works.
Okay. Um, great. Moving on.
Any board leazison feedback? Um,
Director Pack, I'll start with you.
Sorry, I dropped something. Um I don't
think anything anything eventful
happened at the board meeting about
parks yesterday except the mowing
contract and some and I summar
don't don't understand how expensive it
is to maintain 63 plus parks and I think
that's another opportunity if we talk
about it for volunteer projects in
parks. So, I think that's a smart place
to start, but I don't there's nothing on
the horizon. There was. We just need We
need a lot more money for parks. That's
basically it. And I want to piggy back
off for volunteer projects. Just um if
you all are involved with neighborhood
associations or know people who are
that's a great way um to help clean
because they're looking for volunteer
projects all the time. So, pick it up.
Pick it up.
Okay. Um, that's not that's it. We uh
will meet next month, July 9th, at this
same location at 11:45. And thank you,
Mahogany, for helping out with putting
this in its in this new room we're in.
So, so we make a motion to adjurnn. So,
I'll make a motion. Yes. Since we're
ending earlier than our 12:45 expected
time, I move that we end today's meeting
at 12:41 p.m. local time. Second. All in
favor? I I
Did anybody have any Did anybody have
any challenges with this location today?
That parking access, anything that
