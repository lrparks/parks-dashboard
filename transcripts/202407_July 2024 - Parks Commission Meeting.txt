good mahogany I think has me ready to
rock and roll okay cool can you can I
state your name and yeah my name is Ryan
puit I'm a a homeowner in Walton Heights
homeowners association off the South
Ridge Drive and mahogany helps me out a
ton with these presentations in terms of
getting them up and ready um but I'm
here to Simply give an update on the
South Ridge Terrace Park in Walton
Heights that we looked at last week so I
just want to keep you updated as we move
forward um since the last time we spoke
um we have done a couple of things one
is we had a Q&A session um that Leland C
Derk couch facilitated for us I'm I have
some data from that event and we've also
begun fundraising as a neighborhood so I
just wanted to touch base and show you a
little bit um on what we've what we've
done
one of the things we did at the Q&A um
was we asked residents what their
favorite part of the park was and I
stole this from you guys I think at some
of your presentations you do the Pinups
but we had a pinup board you can see it
here you're online but the residents
picked some of the things they favorite
uh or they are excited about with the
park um so I'd invite you as well I'll
leave this behind and you can also put
some pins in it since this is the
community park but there's the location
on our PowerPoint just as a reminder and
then a couple of pictures will be the
next couple of slides showing
the shoots and Ladder style Park that
we're doing
wow or proposing and so this is the park
we've begun to fundraise for and at the
Q&A um most people were you know
generally excited um about just about
all of it but particularly with the
slides the garden areas there's
something we call the eat uh Sip and
play where potentially you can make your
own tee at the Garden the rock climbing
walls um but we had a good number of
people show up including uh Leland but
also energy um attended so that they
could be able to give input and give us
an official um recommendation for any
things they would change or um basically
just an official okay with this park um
and then the next the next slide shows
what we've begun to produce for our
neighbors so these are the postcards we
sent out to all the Neighbors in the
area it's over 460 homes um in the
neighborhood so we sent send out
postcards to everyone's door and if
spoken with neighbors and the next slide
shows a QR code and now I want to pause
right here and all of you can take your
phones out go ahead and get that QR code
and you can donate uh you can purchase a
rock or a slide or of a section of
sidewalk um and we've started
fundraising with the Kickstart and I
think the next slide probably has where
we were at as of
yesterday so and we've started four days
ago and in four days we've raised about
$5,000
as a neighborhood um spread out right
now just between 18 um residents so
we're hoping to keep on um going for 45
days to really try to get a lot of funds
um for this park so you see the there's
a little girl and boy over by the 15
foot slide and they right now are
purchasing something um so that's that's
what we've passed out and what we've run
with um but I think that's what I've got
for now is terms of updates and I'll
happily answer any questions you have
it's now at 5200 just let you know oh
5200 now sweet
yeah that was one of you I bet way to go
Quinton that's probably you right
off yeah that so what's the once you
raise the $10,000 what's the next step
after that um so depending on we're
obviously hoping to get far more than
10,000 um but the next step is whatever
we have fundraised for we will contact
the people who purchase those things and
begin purchase orders for those items
get them approved by um all from this
Commission um and before we proceed with
anything we just need to get approval um
directly from um director couch but
that'd be our next step is to make sure
that the funds are there obtain the
items and get a Contractor on board to
produce
them did you have any uh neighbors who
maybe gave some push back or didn't like
the idea yeah for sure so actually some
of the couple the a couple of the people
that were there um our neighbors were
against it when they had first heard
about it at our annual meeting and then
ever since they've heard it's more of a
park like setting versus a typical
playground structure they talked about
how they're really on board now um and
one of the neighbors um who's really um
kind of for it but then against it he
was really instrumental in some of the
things that we've added to it since the
in initial phase such as a sound barrier
um be able to create that's the arbor
vas shown on the right side of the image
there creting places the sit was uh
another neighbor just didn't think it
was a place for
an elderly generation but it's primarily
for the elderly is a little bit of that
first Terrace um but I'm sure there's
still there's still I'm sure a park in a
neighborhood is not everyone's favorite
but we've getting gotten far
more approvals and I've heard negative
I've actually only had one negative now
out of 470
homes I have a question for Leland so
what's the parks and
wreck involvement and responsibilities
for this is this something you would
take over and maintain once it's built
or are we helping to build it or can you
just kind of give me the abolutely so um
I've so far I've like Ryan said I've
just worked with them on making sure
that everybody is involved and everybody
is aware of it and he's done an
excellent job by far more than anybody
else by coming to all these meetings and
sharing this information and raising the
funds I've indicated that we don't have
any funds for project or development
like this but that if he can raise the
funds and and get the neighborhood and
everybody around him in his in in the
ward and in the neighborhood
particularly um involved and for it then
um I would support it um and we can
maintain it it is a current Park uh
location currently I mean he's not
building a new park um so that's a whole
another conversation just to be clear so
if somebody was to raise money and say
we're going to go build a new park in
West Little Rock or wherever in Little
Rock um that would be another
conversation and that would be much
different this is a current Park and
this is what I consider an improvement
to the park um there will be some
additional maintenance but um uh as many
other Parks have seen improvements from
different groups um even groups that I
know you're aware of um and people raise
money for those improvements we take on
that maintenance and that operation of
those items so I'm supportive of
it and I know you have it broken up up
into I think three phases do you have
cost estimates of what you need to raise
for each of those phases we do the first
um so right now I have a cost estimate
for phase one and two being about
$50,000 that's each no for phase one and
two would be 50,000 so that's phase one
is just that upper tier um and I
estimate that to be about 20,000 and
then phase phase two is a little bit
more because it involves a tunnel and a
bridge and a 15t embankment slide um but
right now that's in phase three I
haven't budgeted at all as that's more
of a a path to connect to Connor park
with potential for the next round of
dreaming I suppose yeah I'll add to this
too Mike and this is going past this
three minute period but since y'all are
asking questions about projects um when
when we first started talking about this
project it was much different we didn't
have plans it was some some idea of a
playground and so it's come a long way
and this is not a um I don't want the
public to think well if we just propose
something and raise some money we can go
do it um this has definitely been how
long have you been working on this you
know I've sat down probably two years
ago I think yeah came yeah so it's been
a long long process and the city
directors of this Ward have been
involved in it and many many other
people years ago good questions and
Cappy met us on site good thank you
thank
you Linda um I just wanted to clarify so
the city owns this laying yes thank you
there is a um Power Line easement in
some of this area but yes this is
already this is considered um River
Mountain it's not uh currently developed
other than a um soft surface Trail and a
parking lot right above it that this is
a joining well I like this one I have
hiked from Connor uh Park up the
hillside across the Hillside and down
the hillside I'm glad to see these kind
of improvements going on there I think
it's nice that it also is a connection
between some other Parks right yeah so
part of the design is um including the
trail system improvements um so there's
there's been a lot of back and forth
that's not maybe not relevant or not
seen here but there has been thank
you well thanks Ryan I appreciate your
time today thank you
all all right we're going to move on to
director report feland if you want to
provide us uh your uh your report please
yeah sure so do we I'll start off do
does anybody have any questions from the
staff reports that have been sent out uh
is the staff report still relevant to
everybody or is there anything that uh
anybody has any general questions on
before I go into uh just a general
report okay seeing none I'll move on um
so I'll just comment a little bit um the
board has always the commission has
always asked me to cover some of the
agenda items some of the larger items um
I will say for the biggest subject
matter that's been ongoing is the sales
tax initiative by the mayor and the City
Board it has been a um ongoing
discussion after every uh board meeting
um I welcome you to come be part of that
at the board meeting uh we had one last
night obviously agenda meeting and there
was a lot of discussion we've answered a
lot of questions and um I believe
believe the mayor is trying to have a
vote on moving forward the board will
support a vote for November um he's
going to bring that to question in uh
next director's meeting on Tuesday the
16th so that'll be an interesting one to
attend um in terms of parks items
outside of that we do have a um RFQ out
for the downtown master plan which is um
focused on designing for the I30
Crossing area park and um that is out
right now for uh submissions and we'll
be reviewing that later this this month
so that's to generate a master plan for
the downtown I30 area there's any
questions on that and then that's just
for that
grassy era just where the old Interstate
30 War where that ramp was and that's
now it's correct there's 15 Acres of
open land down there that was highway is
currently uh not Highway it will it's
understood that it will be eventually uh
turned over with special requests and
easement you know
different processes through R do from
the city to be able to utilize that land
for Park and open space purposes yes and
that's going to happen no matter if the
sales pass sales tax passes or not the
design will happen no matter what um
it's funded from some original arpa
funds as my understanding um the Apple
the actual funds to implement any of it
um there's $10 million in the sales tax
initiative if we don't have the sales
tax um there's not any funding that I
know that's identified for that location
uh there is an ongoing project for that
area um there's some citizens that are
involved in helping raise some funds and
and I've committed some matching
maintenance dollars to try to improve
some of the areas instead of it just
being
um kind of a pasture open grass land is
actually to grow better grass and do
some irrigation and plant some more
trees and make some improvements because
we understand that even through the
master plan process and even if we did
get the sales tax dollars um it's still
going to be some time frame you know two
years or more till we can actually
complete a
project so we're looking at how do we
improve those areas and I'm working with
the central Aras Library System Museum
of Discovery they all have interest in
that land uh so these are all partners
that would be involved in that either on
this initial phase that we're just
looking at how to improve it I've
actually submitted a special request uh
permit for that one area already to R do
and so there's a lot more going on there
but uh we need some funding to be able
to you know do something bigger so thank
you for your question um
so outside of that we have ongoing I had
one more question yeah I didn't see that
sorry the when I read the master plan
for the downtown master plan it seemed
to anticipate and recommend a
separate um
nonprofit uh separate from the city
parks Conservancy that we already have
had established to support Parks right
and I wondered uh how that came to be
and if you had any any more information
about
uh why would there would need to be a
separate support funding uh for that
downtown
part separate from everything we're
trying to do kind of in a master plan
situation so I had the same question um
it was a recommendation from Sasaki who
was who completed the downtown master
plan uh I asked several times in several
ongoing meetings you know and and said
that we do have a Park Conservancy right
now um I even offered several times to
say maybe it could be a subset of that
or grow that um they were very adamant
most of the times that said they needed
they recommended that they have a
separate foundation for downtown that
maybe downtown is not represented uh in
in the process of all that which was a
six-month process whatnot um we actually
um have been updating our board at the
conservancy and Rogers uh Yarnell who
lives downtown is on our board now and
so we have
representation of that exact area so I
can't answer your question any more than
that I mean that's their recommendation
um I still believe that one strong um
Foundation would be best but um we'll
see what happens in the future um
so yep any other questions on that
matter okay so I'll just go through the
quick agenda items and this this is a
mix of of over the last two or three
meetings but so I did bring up the
outdoor recreation Grant here um so that
was in front of uh the board last night
and so I still appreciate your support
on that and that will be voted on um
next week we've also are using some of
our arpa funds for different projects
and there's we're including uh some new
fiber runs at our resman golf course and
so due to the cost of that
infrastructure um we have taken that to
the board as well and then some things
that have passed that have already gone
past but just to give keep you updated
and I think I brought some of this up
before the last meeting but it's been
since then is a Southwest Community
Center we did have a um uh Carson and
Associates is our selected vendor
successful vendor for that that's
roughly a $700,000 project that's passed
through the board as well as um some
replacement uh cost $60,000 for dumbar
roof for our community center there and
then also we finished our contract or we
didn't finish but we got it approved
through the board was Western Hills for
Byer and Jones who's a contractor
company to do $800,000 worth of
improvements at Western Hills and that
is a continuation of a legacy we Grant
we received almost four years ago so um
all the stuff that I'm referring to and
all of that are either Grant funds or
arpa funds um just a note I was just
just kind of caught that as I was
looking at my numbers but that's where
we get all of our funding from right now
outside of our maintenance dollars so um
that is my report uh a lot of emphasis
right now on the sales tax and our arpa
excuse me arpa and bond projects so is
there any other questions outside of
that thanks L I appreciate it I I would
like i' like to know on here um we do
have um Angela is missing our deputy
director of admin she's out on medical
leave lesana Dean is acting as our
deputy director today and um we have a
new Miss Rainey is our new Revenue
compliance analysis so we have some uh
few little HR changes within our
department and um excited about having
some new staff so those are a few little
staff updates thank you
any other questions for Leland or any of
the uh uh the part
staff well just I hope I hope we you
guys continue to read the reports I know
they're not they're not introduced or or
talked about or presented I guess is the
right term uh in this board meeting but
I hope you guys have a chance to read it
and feel free to ask some questions uh
during this uh during this time frame
because they do put a lot of work into
those reports so I appreciate the staff
and Leland for uh for for the for those
reports so we're going to move on to
presentations I don't think there's any
presentations today so um unfinished
business
um I kind of want
to add not add but combine the the first
two bullets as well as the the bullet on
on new business into Cano one um I know
this has been on on the agenda like the
past three or four months and I would
like today to to
finally
select
what what uh subcommittee you want to be
on um I know I've gotten a couple of
requests that what what they recommend
but I think today and this probably
needs a me to do a new business but
let's let's actually I want each
commission member to select what SubCom
they want to be in because this has this
has been going on for a few months and I
think I think once that happens we can
start having um some very
short short updates each report and
gives you guys the ability to work on
things and work on work with the staff
on social media to me is more than just
social media it's marketing and and
advertising and and master plan is is a
hole in itself that that needs to have
subcommittee as well as parts conserv so
I would I would like to get this done
today in new
business and I hope you guys are willing
to volunteer for which one you want to
select
so do anyone any questions on unfinished
business at all M Mr chair um have you
already appointed the chairs of the the
each of the
subcommittees I'm trying to if if there
the sub have a chair I
know Linda are you still this the chair
for I I was appointed over a year ago uh
for the master plan and it does not as I
read the bylaws indicate that there is a
term limit okay so I would I suspect
that I am still that
person okay does the
do we have a chair currently for the
parks Conservancy I don't think we do I
think it was um Matt I believe buoy so
how would do we need to do can we do
that now as well yes um the the chair
yourself can make the the appointment of
a chair for each Linda as I understand
is the chair the um yes is it master
plan or it's master plan so if Parks
Conservancy liais on and the out social
media does not have a chair then you
would make that appointment and then the
chair of each subcommittee would would
um populate their committee with with
members and then that that would be
approved by the overall commission okay
so for today we will
select subcommittee
chairs and then they have until nut
month to select their members would that
be
okay that that's fine and then the full
commission can can vote correct yeah we
just don't need that done by email it
needs to be done in a in a business
meeting yeah
um okay anyone have questions on or
concerns or comments
on what we just talked
about okay uh how how are we so like I'm
I'm interested in being part of the
master plan uh
programmer board um but I also would
like to help with the social media by
just offering all the pictures that we
take of uh the three locations we have
here in Little Rock for park services so
how are we gonna do do it be voted on
volunteer what what do we do members be
on more than one
subcommittee uh we'll need a a chair
appointed by by yourself chair France
the parks Conservancy uh committee and
then the Outreach and social media
committee and I guess can can a
commission member be on two
subcommittees I don't see why not
there's no prohibition to
that
okay okay any
uh any comments on unfinished business
whether that's what I just talked about
or the sales tax initiative um I have a
suggestion maybe uh if people have an
interest we could go around today and
hear some of that so that we understand
who might have an interest in being on a
certain committee and uh while I am I
guess technically the chair if if you
want to make another appointment to
master planning I mean I can continue or
you can replace me I don't I don't
really mind whatever you want to do
Ben I'll think about it Linda okay you
have the
power then for me my question would be
where are expectations or
responsibilities for these Comm I think
it's up to you how much you want to put
into it I mean I don't think it I mean
it talks a little bit about each
subcommittee and the bylaws I don't have
it in front of me but I think it's it's
up to you
guys on the on the master plan it does
have some specific responsibilities
listed um
and to consult with and advise the
director on the Master Parks plan and
the best approach for implementation
including but not limited to
prioritizing projects and recommending
Capital funding
allocations so that's pretty directly
related to master planning there's
others there's you know several
responsibilities listed in here but
that's the one that's most closely
applicable
and really it talks about the master
plan book and then we also have this
strategic plan and I guess Leland's soon
going to be updating the Strategic part
of
it yeah I I'll take a moment to comment
too so last year was it last year Linda
Linda became chair and so she was very
active and set we had I guess two
different meetings maybe at City Hall um
it sounds like it's a trouble to set a
meeting because we have to to
notify um press that we meeting um but
it's not we can um set up an email and
notify and so my recommendation and my
it would be helpful for the Department
is if the CH if the Committees were um
established and then we did have
meetings that we discuss different
things and to hear y'all's point of view
but also to educate y'all on different
components of the department um and for
us to be advised on different concerns
and you all have a particular interest
in the Parks Department
and it's different than you're a little
bit different than just a a citizen um
like Ryan is back there Ryan has a very
particular interest and is focused on
one area of his neighborhood whereas I'm
hopeful the Commissioners here are more
focused on uh the whole different
spectrum of of the department and so um
I believe it would be beneficial and
then as things arise if there was a
social media issue or something maybe
Britney had a social media issue or a
concern or a request we could bring it
to that committee right or we could say
we would like to meet with the committee
and same with the master plan um back
and forth but without the committee's uh
established um it's challenging to
utilize well there's nothing really to
to utilize and so um I've asked Ben just
to help just to Mo kind of push forward
and I think any of y'all would be great
on any of the committee and I was also
commenting that the committees or the
the subc committies don't I mean it does
say social media right but I mean we
don't have to limit our scope to social
media it could be a very wide scope same
with the master plan the master plan
could be the whole master plan for the
whole department or we could get into uh
project Justin's working on and we could
narrow down to to one um and same with
the park cons Serv the Park Conservancy
doesn't have to be just the actual Park
Conservancy that we actually uh have
today it could be a broader spectrum of
of donations and how do we raise money
for different projects ultimately that's
utilizing the Park
Conservancy um but anyway I just maybe
that will help give a broader kind of
concept but I would I would be excited
as a director to be able to say we've
you know championed the the Committees
and we can move forward and now we know
that um we can uh utilize the committees
as part of the
commission okay well let's uh anything
let's get into new business if that's
okay so what we just talked about were
Commissioner of subcommittee selections
I think we want to go ahead
and and see if anyone has any desire to
be a chair of each committee
subcommittee I would I would since
has has history I'd love for her to be
here again
if um so I
would do I nominate her just say go can
I nominate is that how we need to do you
would you would actually make the
appointment hey Ben you're
appointed hey
JT
hey
um so Linda if you don't want to do it
I'll do it but you have to be on the
committee right and JT that would be
fabulous if you're allowed can as Vice
chair can he be the head of a committee
yes that's JT that would be a fabulous
uh uh way to move
forward okay all right I got you off the
hook thank you all right JT I'm going to
nominate you
then thank you JT
um and I'm happy to do the social media
if if if no one else wants to do it so
thank you Britney is just
like all right parts
Conservancy I think this might be the
one that's a little unknown I know last
year uh we did a golf tournament to help
raise funds for activities during the
summer camp playground I think that was
a parts Conservancy
somewhat sponsored thing so it could be
that's just an example what you could do
for to help with Parks Conservancy
um but it it's it's it is the nonprofit
private that works and helps with
different projects L might be able to
speak better about an example of
something that just because it's a
little less known than probably um
master plan and social media so um yes
the park cons servy is its own
um Foundation we have an active board we
just met uh they are in the process of
of raising different funds through
different um ways they actually are
working with some of the Commissioners
already um they work with some of our um
different facilities and setting up
different accounts there's a lot of
different things they do um they are
trying to be
more um more than that in terms of
raising more funds and doing more
sponsorships and we're working through
that um but in terms of
actually us with the previous uh golf
golf stuff I mean that could even be
whites side is uh you've mentioned
something to me about being involved in
that that could be a social activity
that raises money and we just parked the
money at the Conservancy is really all
Matt was doing with that um so you could
move that around um okay the the chair
my recommendation would be to find
somebody that is wants to be active and
trying to go out and find sponsors and
people that wanted to do projects like
Ryan back there who is raising money and
and how can we supplement that or or do
more of that or or name a facility or
naming rights and or finding people that
want to donate money we have tons of
people that give money for sculpture
projects for example and very uh that's
that's great but there's also other
projects too and how can we you know
raise money or there's different
volunteer groups that raise money for
improvements of different facilities
that they have interest in how can we
grow that or how can we recognize those
people and bring that to the Public's
attention and think about this it's if
you donate money to the conserv it's tax
deductible as opposed to you know giving
it to the city which I don't think
that's even you can do that I don't know
but anyway it's just an Avenue for to to
raise funds for for different projects
that's related to the part so does
anyone have interest in being the uh
Parts Conservancy
chair as someone that deals with a lot
of uh guests and gets to Showcase a lot
of parks in Little Rock um I I'd like to
volunteer for that that position thank
you
Sam Sam I might have a request for you
uh I've had several people ask me how
much money that group has and I never
have an answer so maybe we could get an
update on that at least once a
year as soon as I know the answer to
that that that was a quick turnar around
right I'll talk to my people and uh do
some Googling and I'll let you know
before the meeting's over so Beth for
for the next meeting is is the CH the
each chair of the sub committee will
will select who they want to who how
would that work sorry at the next
meeting um the chair of each committee
would make selections and appointments
to their particular committee and then
that would be approved the appointments
for the each committee be approved by
the that'll be a new business okay
pardon me that'll be a new business next
month yes okay
okay well if you have interest um in any
of the subcommittees please reach out to
Sam Quinn or uh or
JT okay the final aspect or final point
of new business if you look in your
packet I have written a letter
that I would like to I would like to
send to the board that has our support
for the sales tats
initiative um the past three or four
months you guys have have gotten updates
from Leland about the sales tats you
also um I think some of us have actually
went into some of these sales tax
meetings that have been in each Ward um
so I think we spent a lot of time on
this and I and I think it's now time for
us to do a formal
letter uh that we can then present to
the mayor and the board
directors um showing the parts support
for uh the cell stats uh I'm going to
let you guys read it
but I would like to vote on this
today because we want we want to make
sure we vote on it before the board
votes for the sales taxs that will then
if they vote Yes they will then go to
the public vote so I open up to any
questions or comments about this letter
um if not I'm g go ahead and put it to a
vote but any questions or comments on
the letter itself
um I I thought it was a great letter um
I think you need a period after the word
consideration at the bottom there you an
attorney yeah sorry no you're good thank
you thank you that that's really I
thought it was great though very very
short and right to the
point anyone else move we adopt this
letter in uh recognition of our support
for the sales tax I
second okay all in favor I all
opposed letter
passes all
right I believe if I may that the next
step would be for you to sign the letter
and then director couch if if you you
wouldn't mind if your staff could
facilitate um getting the letter um of
possibly emailed to to the mayor the
mayor's Chief of Staff the mayor's
senior advisor the members of the City
Board of Directors acting city manager
just because your department probably
has all that information to help
facilitate getting this out to the
addresses of the
letter I can do that can through that
list one more time mayor it's going to
be the mayor and the mayor's Chief of
Staff Miss pu the the mayor's senior
advisor um Christopher Harvey uh then

Directors the acting city

B okay so agenda items for net meeting
uh we've already talked about um the the
chairs of each subcommittee will uh you
know select or get interest from uh
other members to be on their board any
other agenda items for for new business
for next for next
meeting I will we go about joining
committees I would just reach out to Sam
or um JT or Quinton sh France we'll need
to we'll need to have the discussion at
the next regular business meeting just
be thinking about what okay you would
like to be on and then it'll be um I
guess under old business um during the
next U business meeting next month um
and we can discuss more then about what
Comm committees you'd like to be
on
okay um okay any Bor L on
feedback I think it would also be
helpful for
um for us to discuss what's required
requested
responsibilities I want to know if I'm
doing a good job or a bad
job um just so we can kind of know what
what to shoot for also figure out if we
need to meet once a month just just some
basic bullet I'll send out to everyone
the uh this the the bylaws that that
state some of the
the rule the responsibilities I'll be
sure to do
that and that also email it
though you could also tell me how much
money is in the budget so I could tell
it's a million dollars okay uh Linda a
million dollars apparently it was like
43,000 so wait wait what which budget
I'm sorry the the Conservancy
Conservancy budget no no no yeah so
since we have a few minutes I'll Circle
back to that I I would recommend
requesting the executive director which
is an interim right now um or or whoever
she wants to have come but do a one year
pre you know once a year
presentation I think would be beneficial
to this group okay um but I mean at the
same time we can also ask for the next
meeting here just what their current
balances to for Linda but I think it
would be relevant to have them come you
know maybe it's every end of the year
December or something and they come to
our meeting and give a report on what
the accompl accomplishments are for the
foundation we we can do this after the
meeting but I just need access
to those those documents and information
and any online portal things and uh just
make sure I know for the foundation the
foundation yes it's mostly from just
from the foundation there's not any ties
so um I I'll put you in contact with the
uh director that'd be wonderful thank
you Sam thank
you okay
um it's
1245 record um next meeting is August 14
24 at
12:00 meeting
ajour one of the fastest and wonderful
presentation and finished early that's
