All right. Um number five on the agenda

within uh or each staff in their in
their division within parts. Um I'm
going to turn it over to Leland to have
a director's report and if any of the
staff members wants to talk if you have
any questions just please ask them
because they're all here. So, I'll turn
it over to Leland to talk about any of
the board director agenda items and go
down to staff reports.
>> Okay. Thank you, Ben. So, one of our
most recent uh board agenda items is the
Jim Dailyaly. Good afternoon, Mayor.
>> Tell everybody thank you for all you
guys do. A lot of great things have been
happening in parks and uh we have a
great staff but most important we have a
great commission and just wanted to
share my appreciation to each one of you
guys.
>> Thanks mayor.
>> That's it. Bye. Good to see you.
>> We got lunch down the hall if you want
some lunch. Was it tacos for lunch?
>> Yeah.
>> Thank you guys.
>> There's
chips though.
Um, so anyway, where I was was talking
about the board items um last night,
Tuesday night. So we um I took the Jim
Daily um roof repair to the board. Uh
there were no questions from the board.
That is a approximately $700,000 roof
repair. A lot of questions could be
asked about that, but I'll share that if
there's just if there's any uh
clarification on the project. Um are
I'll just ask too is there any staff uh
report questions from the commissioners?
So hearing none, I'll move on to um
events. Um Graham, would you come up and
just share any current events? I know we
have some uh exciting uh ribbon cutings
coming up and different projects. So if
you'd share a few of those.
um from 9:30 to noon. I sent you all the
email with a flyer and the Facebook
event link. Uh if you wanted to RSVP,
you could. We hope to see you all there.
And if you could just spread the word to
anyone who is interested in baseball or
sports or just your community. Um that's
our big event right now. We have some
other projects that are underway that
we'll be planning ribbon cutings for um
probably in the fall. But yeah,
>> thanks for sending that email out a
couple weeks ago. It's good to have it
on our our radars. So, I appreciate you
doing that.
>> No problem.
>> Yeah, we plan on at the event, the
ribbon cutting is a little bit more than
just a um saying a few words. We're
actually um Graeme, could you share a
little bit?
>> So, we'll be doing all sorts of events.
a lot of it geared towards kids. Um
we'll be doing a home home run derby, uh
relay race around the bases. We'll have
some yard games like cornhole, um face
painting and a lot of just and I think a
snow cone truck and some cracker jacks
and other snacks. So
>> awesome.
>> Yeah,
should be a fun time.
>> Have how many people have RCPD? Have you
had you count?
>> Uh no, I mean we'll we'll have some of
the summer day camps there, so there
will be at least a
>> Oh, awesome. Um, a couple hundred
probably.
>> Great. Yeah.
>> So, Graham is also over our data and
marketing. Are there any questions for
um for Graham on on any aspects of that?
>> Do you want me to Okay. So, one one of
the things I wanted to add to new
business next time maybe is um prior to
your arrival here, we had talked about
creating a features directory and how
useful that would be. Uh, so right now
we have parks and wreck and you know I
can look up on Kynanis Park or Boil Park
whatever. I can see what's there.
>> But what would be really useful I think
to the community is if they had a
directory that said you know softball
located at all these places, pickle ball
located at all these places. Yes. You
know what all the different features
that we have.
>> Um so you guys could put something like
that together.
>> Yes. We are looking to restructure the
parks website. Um the city as a whole is
moving to a new platform soon. So it's
kind of uh we're kind of in a hold on
making major updates for now. Um but
that is something we'll look to do is
have it listed by activity as well as by
location.
>> Okay. So can we have that like as an
agenda item, not as a you know not
necessarily that there would be
something next month, but we just kind
of carry it as a bullet so that when
Graham's ready to present that to us, he
could.
>> I'm asking you, Ben.
>> Yeah. I mean, I think I don't know if
that would be new business, but I think
we could include that in uh just under
the uh whenever Graham you speak under
your under the staff reports if you want
to just comment on the progress of how
that's going.
>> Yes, do that.
>> Thank you.
One of the other things that would be
great and not for probably next month
but at some point in the future would be
um walking through sort of the
the website or assets that we have that
are at our disposal like 247 whether it
be Facebook, Instagram and or the
website so that we're more aware of when
people ask us questions I can point them
like hey yeah I remember you need to go
to the website or you need to
here to sign up for that or that would
be helpful. Um I know a lot of progress
was made in the last like 12 15 months
but I feel now when I go on there I
don't necessarily know where things are
but it looks a lot better and I mean I
think the things are there's more things
there than I realize I guess is what I'm
trying to get to
>> on the website or
>> and just in general on social media and
whatnot. I'm not on some of the social
media platforms. So, but I'd like to be
able to point people, hey, yeah, that's
where you can go if you want to sign up
and get
>> there is there's a lot of information on
the website right now. You just sort of
have to dig around for it. And so, we
want to make a better structure that's
easier to navigate.
>> Um, but on our social media, there's a
lot of information about um ongoing
events and just things we're doing like
the day camp, there's uh we just posted
a video, an update for that. So
definitely check out we have Facebook,
LinkedIn, Instagram. Um so be sure if
you have those um channels, follow us on
all of those.
>> Just to make a request and more more so
for just a note, um the Arkansas River
Trail pedestrian bike trail um if we
could when you're redoing or updating
the website, uh that has not been
updated since 2017. And um if we could
uh create a more in informative trail
map for that, I think that connects all
the parks and I think it was a very
special part of Little Rock.
>> Uh it just needs to be updated.
>> Okay. Is there not a um is there not a
Arkansas River Trail website?
>> There used to be, but I it's gone away.
>> It's gone away. We have created our own
map for the website for our website that
is interactive and overlays with Google
so you can see where you are in real
time on the trail and also points of
interest. Um that's cool
>> that that I think would really benefit
the city to
>> look as well.
>> Okay.
>> Graham also I don't think it's come up
but would you share just briefly about
your newsletter and maybe this is an
opportunity to
>> Yeah. So we um we're starting a
newsletter this month. It actually goes
out at 1 p.m. today. Um, I added you all
to the subscriber list, but uh,
>> so don't unsubscribe and spam it. All
right, got it.
>> Yeah. So, that'll just, um, right now
our list is a little over a thousand
people that have signed, um, signed in
at different events, but it's just going
to be some updates from what's been
going on the past month and in the
upcoming month of things we're doing in
parks and wreck. So whether that be
events or signups for sports or
construction projects.
>> Yeah. And I I just wanted to add that I
follow you on Instagram and I feel like
the content is always new and fun at Jim
Dailyaly or with the mayor or somebody,
you know, it's always fun. Um so I think
you are doing a great job with that.
>> Any other questions for Graham?
>> Great stuff, man. Thanks.
>> Thank you.
Gabrielle, do you have anything to add?
You're good. How's everything? Are you
on month two or three?
>> I think it should be automatic.
>> Okay. Awesome. So, Gabby is is working
with uh Graham. They're they're a good
partnership is what I can tell so far.
So,
>> cool.
>> Um Shamia has uh logged in as well and
so she's on the
Hey, Kamiya. Shamia.
>> Okay. Uh, all right. Uh, next item on
the agenda is presentation. I think JP's
Do you have a Is it like actual
PowerPoint presentation or just
>> Yes, we have PowerPoint.
>> Oh, cool.
>> Yeah. J JP is a very seasoned
presenter. No, I'm just kidding. He's
good.
>> So, uh, my name is JP Rogers. I'm the
parks maintenance manager. Uh I've been
in this position about three years, been
with the city 23. So I came over from
the golf side. So I've been on private
public sector with golf. So I had
several several years of experience in
high-end maintenance. Currently, like I
said, I'm kind of building out the uh
the maintenance division. We got
I can wing it but
>> visualize
talking's never been an issue for me.
You can ask my co-workers.
>> Is there a way to change it from here?
Okay,
>> I'll point. Okay, go to the next slide.
So, as you can see, maintenance is one
of the largest divisions within parks.
We touch everything in some way or
another. We have a $1.7 million budget.
We have about 42 employees that were
authorized for. As you can see on the
slides, we are a little short. I've been
constantly trying to hire.
Unfortunately, in this our current
economic condition, we're not as
competitive. So, it's been hard to keep
up. I I gain two, lose three. I had two
I had one retire and one quit last month
just as I hired two people. I have three
more coming online. So, we have 63
parks, four splash pads, 34 pavilions.
It's 26 miles from our large if we have
to drive from one our farthest west park
to our farthest east park. We have 55
vehicles. I have garbage trucks. I have
large mowers. I have small mowers. This
isn't all of our vehicles. That's just
the ones that we actually track. So, we
have a lot of people and a lot of things
moving around. Those people bump into
things, equipment breaks, that slows us
down. That was spent yesterday. Somebody
somebody bumped something and we had to
go do the paperwork. Um, go ahead. But,
as you can see, we have a lot of area to
cover. I mean, it's we have four crews.
Go ahead and go to the next.
Uh, we have 30 parks that are done with
contractors. I want you to pay attention
to this number. They do about 150 acres
under these uh contractors. They take
care of 30 smallest parks basically. Uh
MacArthur Park,
even the uh median down Highway 10,
Canantrol out here, we actually mow
that. It's our responsibility. A
contractor takes care of it, but we used
to mow it. We have a contractor now. Uh
of course, Riverfront, we are trying to
hit all these areas. And then um we have
the eight facilities the that the
contractors handle.
>> When I I'm sorry. Is it okay to ask
questions during the should?
>> Anytime you have a question, please.
>> When do you decide whether to contract
or whether to do it yourself?
>> So I inherited these contracts. Um they
were already kind of set. We we did
tweak them some when I was coming in.
Leland and I came in about three years
ago. These contracts expire this next
May. We're actually in the process of re
rewriting them now. We're going to
change how we do them. Probably going to
break them up into several smaller ones.
>> We have three We have two contractors
with three contracts.
>> Okay.
>> Um
it's worked out, but we've learned and
we're going to probably go to a try and
break it up into a more regional
contract situation. I I don't know
exactly how that's going to look, but we
will know that. We'll have that out and
hopefully out for bid by the end of
August, 1 of uh September, because it
will take us that long to get everything
past legal board of directors for next
year.
>> Okay.
>> Um
go ahead and go to our So, my crews, the
crews I work with, we have uh the other
33 parks, we have 512 acres of area that
we actually take care of. That's our
high intensity. We broke it up. We have
over 1500 acres in the parks that we
take care of at some level, but the 512
I do that with currently 13 people
they're mowing.
Um, well that this same crew has to do
Pav. So this is my maintenance division.
They do mowing, they do pavilion setup,
they clean the bathrooms. We have 26
bathrooms that we have to clean. We try
to clean them every day. I have three
people that do that. They also pick up
trash inside all 63 parks. We have a
garbage truck we're very proud of
because it makes our lives easier and
they go around and we run it twice a
week. I'd run it three times or four
times if I had the uh employees, but we
don't. So they and they uh we we empty
trash even up into the Heights Hillrest
area along the street up there. Those
are ours. A lot of it down here in River
Market, that is ours. The trash truck
doesn't go to all of those. Um some of
it's
just a person in a truck pulling a bag.
Some of it's a garbage truck. So, 19
people on that crew supposed to be,
which currently have 13. I have three
more in the pipeline to hire. They
should be on board within the next 30 to
60 days, but I can't guarantee that we
won't lose two more in that period of
time. I mean, that's pretty much the way
we've been. Every time we get up, we
seems like we lose two more.
>> Hey, can I ask you a quick question?
Yes. Um,
on the garbage, is it more the like down
on the river or some of the more built
out parks like they're sort of ornate or
nicer looking? But then at some places,
and I'll use reservoir because I was
over there the other day. Um,
something that I saw, and it's more of a
general question for you guys, and I'm
getting there. When we do a contract for
city of Tulsa outside of like their
basketball, tennis, pickle ball areas,
they have like standard trash cans that
you'd see for like I think the city uses
waste management or something. But
>> they come and pick those up there. The
city does their own municipal trash.
>> Yes.
>> Where here it's
something that's an opportunity or
>> it could be if we had money. I don't
have the contract dollars to really I
mean so the currently the city does have
in the downtown area waste management
does empty some of the trash cans down
here.
>> Okay.
>> And that's done through public works.
>> Gotcha.
>> Because public works so we also maintain
I was go to this another slide. All of
downtown we do all the landscaping down
Main Street all along Clinton. All of
that is everything that's if it's public
that's ours. All those hanging baskets.
We water every one of those every day
this time of year. So, we also do a lot
of the trash, but like I said, public
works does. And we've we're looking at
outsourcing what we can. It's just my
contract dollars are rather limited. So,
>> Gotcha.
>> Because we we were real skeptical when
we saw it like
>> a recycling in a trash can next to two
basketball courts. Like, no one, you
know, this is going to be lit on fire
tomorrow or something. And it's people
were throwing trash. We saw people in
the parks picking up trash and putting
it in there. I mean, like when there was
something visible
>> that was uniform, people used it. I was
just
>> sort of amazed.
Yeah, we put those out. We we've tried
recycling. We just don't have the uh
ability and the people to actually that
go out and do that. As far as, you know,
we would love to contract some of this
stuff out, but a lot of our trash cans
we can contract because they're in the
park. We actually have somebody in truck
drives out, drives through the park,
pulls a bag, throws it in the pickup
truck, and goes. It's easy with the
equipment like, and that's what we do.
Our garbage truck has a special clamp on
the back it grabs and flips it in.
>> But he can't get that to about 60. We
have like 250 plus garbage cans that we
empty every week.
>> We empty about a third of those every
day. The other two/3 are two to three
times a week. It just depends based on
use. We also have a lot of dumping in
the parks. We spend a lot of time out
and we do a roofing material,
construction material. Somebody cleans
out a house, they go to a park, they
dump it in the street just to pull over.
Boil park is one of the worst time and
it was really bad. They'll pull up. I've
actually sat there in a city truck and a
guy p was sitting here shoveling the
stuff off. So I it's you know the burden
we bear. So uh our other next department
is horiculture which is uh does all the
design and install and maintenance on
flower beds. We've actually been scaling
that back because we don't have they
used to have when I when I started with
the city this one that I'm running now
had 60 employees. I have 42 and we had
four less parks I believe. So we we keep
increasing the maintenance level keeps
increasing. Our funding and our u
manpower levels are actually lower than
we were. So we have to adapt. Some of
that's m some of that's contracting some
of it's trying to do some different
things. Um but the horiculture group
they they've inherited all of our sports
fields. We had a sports field crew for
years. We now no longer have that. 2019
they were folded in to other positions.
So now they are also taking care of
sports field. The only sports field we
maintain highly are is interstate and
then recreation takes care of West
Central which is the only two areas that
have really and but there we kind of
started rebuilding that. My background
is turf so that's one thing that I've
kind of emphasized but we don't we don't
have them to the level we'd like yet but
we're working on it.
Go ahead. Go to the next one.
So horiculture actually has two crews.
The other crew is uh takes care of the
downtown district. They are um
they have a lot to cover. They're the
reason I don't know if you've noticed
been down in Main Street or if you've
been down Riverfront, we've really had a
turnaround down there. We've uh kind of
changed the crew makeup, had some
personnel changes. We've I've got a
couple of hard chargers down there.
They're really pushing. So that's one
area that we've the city has asked that
we emphasize. We're trying to get them,
you know, trying to keep them supported.
They've made a difference. They're only
the horiculture crew overall has 14
people. They're only short one right
now. Um that's actually we have we have
some changes coming to that one. So
we'll be looking at some people
retiring, things like that in the next
year. So we're going to have some some
changes there. Also, go ahead.
Trails is uh relatively new. We didn't
have a trails crew for a long time. We
just as I started, we hired a trail
coordinator. We uh recently replaced
him. He he left for another job. We
replaced him about a year and a half
ago. Another young gentleman that's
really pushing hard. Kind of emphasized
more on maintenance rather than
outreach.
He's uh he's built up his crew. We now
have three people over there. And that's
they they do a little bit of everything.
We have over 100 miles of hard and soft
surface trail that we have to deal with
and we're talking, you know, edging,
cutting it back, trying to keep the
clearances. We weren't doing that for
many years. Now we are. I've seen a
difference. I ride these trails. I keep
a bike on my wall downstairs and I go
ride the trails. So, I don't mountain
bike. That's a good way to hurt
yourself. I already learned that. So,
um,
but they've they've they've been really
pushing. We're starting to see a
difference. He's helped with some uh up
at River Mountain started to do some
repairs up there on that. We had a
really nice facility. We don't want it
to be get away from us. Go ahead. Last
one's urban forestry. This is the one we
get the most questions and calls about.
They work with multiple departments
within the city. Code enforcement, um
planning, permitting. They do all of the
like this recent storm, we had over 300
trees down. They did everything in house
about removal. They've got they've got a
fiveperson crew. They're fully staffed
right Now, I've got one of those about
to retire. And uh so we've got I mean
they they push hard, but it's a small
crew and they have a lot of ground to
cover all 63 parks. They do all the tree
limb removal. They do all the dead tree
removal. If there's a we have to go cut
around all the traffic lights, all of
the uh uh street lights. If there's a
problem, we we trim around it. We don't
work on private property, but we do have
we do have a um we do have a lot of
ground to cover with them. Go ahead.
So, you know, urban forester works under
them. He is a he's an arbor certified
arborist. We do if So, if um 311
receives a complaint about a dead tree
enforcement calls us, we drive by and
go, "Yes, that's" He looks at it says,
"Yes, that's an issue." Then they will
issue uh the warnings and fines or
whatever that they have to do with that.
But we do work with them. So, they have,
like I said, they're f they're fully
staffed right now, but that's about to
change.
You asked me for some challenges and
opportunities. So, as you can see, you
know, funding is always an issue. And
we're we're we make the biggest impact.
Always tell the everybody that nobody
notices what we do until we don't do it.
So, I mean, we can we can be doing
really hard and everything's great and
it's seamless and nobody says a word.
the minute we don't empty the trash or
the minute a mower breaks down and we
can't get to an area, that's when
everybody starts to call. So, you know,
we we're trying to go some uh natural
areas like so we've got these large
expanses that we're covering. We're
trying to look at doing a little lower
more low mo out of him. We kind of did a
pilot project because we're trying to
mow that old golf course. I actually ran
that golf course for a couple years. Now
it's not. And instead of mowing it every
week, we're trying to mow. We mow around
the trails and then do the other areas,
let it be more native, you know,
pollinator gardens, uh, wildlife cover,
and then we come through about twice a
year and knock it down so it doesn't
become trees like Western Hills did. Um,
of course, you know, everybody has a
high expectation. You want everybody you
walk in a park, you want to look like
your front yard. Unfortunately,
we can't keep up right now, especially
with all the rain we've had. We're
ideally once a week, every 7 to nine
days you would mow. Our goal is every
10. We're at every 14 to 16 right now
just because of what it takes, you know.
Plus, we have to clean up areas, tennis
courts, pickle ball courts, bathrooms,
uh pick up the trash, and then back fill
in other areas that, you know, we'll get
a call that we've got a problem in a
park. And that we'll have to pull crews.
Right now, I've got people out at West
Central getting ready for the grand
opening. They don't have enough staff
there, so we're helping them out. So, is
anybody got any questions or
>> I've got a few. Um, you mentioned 311.
Is that a Justin had mentioned that you
might be getting rid of 311? I think you
told me that. Or maybe not. Let me let
me just ask you. Is 311 you're some
we're planning on keeping?
>> I have no idea. That's that's above my
pay grade. We don't that 311. All we do
is we receive that there's an issue in
the park.
>> Receive the work.
>> Yes, sir. I I I have no
>> So, it's a good app if you know along
>> if you have a problem. Yes. You send it
to them and they will route it to us.
>> Right. So, if along the way they decide
to replace that, definitely advocate for
something similar. And then I was going
to mention, but it doesn't sound like
it's in your ballpark, that on the 311
app, like if you go to a park, it'll
have a category for like playground
equipment or streets, but it doesn't
actually have anything for the
facilities, which would be good. Like if
you want to report something in the
bathroom, if
>> that that's we we have conversations
with them and they've basically and it's
been a I haven't dealt with that in a
long time. It' be more Justin and
Leland, but they've we've given them
like the top three or four. Problem we
were having was they were we used to
have a whole bunch of them and they were
all over the place.
>> Right.
>> Um so I spend most of my time at Kanis
Park.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Um I just want to give kudos to that
crew. They are fantastic. They do a
great job all around the park. Um one of
the things I used to report quite a bit
was graffiti.
Um, which you know, my unofficial
observation is is that if they if
somebody puts graffiti on a wall, if you
remove it right away, it doesn't
propagate, but if you leave it there,
then it it seems to, you know, encourage
more. Um, I think the people that are
cleaning the bathroom at Kanis may have
added the chemicals to just remove it as
they go, which makes a lot more sense
when they're cleaning the bathroom if
they see it, just to remove it. We
remove everything we can if the if it
depends on what it's at. So the bathroom
crews, yes, they have special wipes that
they'll if they can get it off. If they
can't, we have to call the construction
side. They have a uh person that handles
gets a contractor out and does it,
pressure washes it or paints it. We
don't we don't actually do any painting.
When they say maintenance, it's kind of
we uh we just do the cleaning, the
cutting, pickup. We don't do
construction projects really other than
Trails does some, right?
Well, again, kudos to that crew. They
do, you know, from the the grass cutting
to the quartz cleaning to the bathroom
maintenance. They all they do a great
job.
>> Yeah, it's just Yeah. Well, I appreciate
it. They And like I said, it's one crew
that does all of them. So, we're not
just there. We're at every the the same
crews go to every park.
>> Uh JP, can you help clarify the graffiti
and in particular to Mike's comment, the
graffiti that it would be on the
interstate there? We don't
>> that's not ours. So the if it we have to
be careful because the freeway walls
belong to the state and they if we we'd
have to paint it and they won't let us
do that. We've talked with them and
they're very adamant that don't touch my
stuff. So
>> they they've been doing a pretty good
job. The graffiti I was talking about is
actually in the bathroom. So they it's
on the steel stainless steel or on the
wall.
>> Yeah. We um
>> it's amazing how quickly something we we
can clean a bathroom and if you you get
the wrong person in there and this just
looks like we haven't been near it in
weeks, but it's we do we do hit them hit
them every day. So
>> thank you.
>> Thank you so much. Uh what park do you
have like the most maintenance
challenges or takes up a lot of time?
Like if you had is does anyone just like
stand out to you?
>> I mean just depends on the time of year.
Murray Park is probably our because it's
our highest use as far as rentals.
So, we get a lot of calls about it.
Everybody wants to little Timmy's
birthday's coming up and I want the
grass mode today and it's like we'll we
were there last week. We'll be there as
soon as we can. Like I said, right now I
can't guarantee less than 14 days
unfortunately. So, we get that that um
of course Riverfront gets a lot of usage
and of course it but it has basically a
dedicated crew. uh boil park we have you
know a lot of dumping issues thous
are are those you know our high use
parks MacArthur and it's usually a
bathroom issue tall grass and bathrooms
and then snakes everybody's seen a snake
in the park so um
unfortunately there's nothing I can do
about that but uh you know that we we do
uh we do work on them and try to get
everything you know if we get a
complaint we try to address it within 24
hours can't always guarantee that but we
do try
>> I also like to share to follow up on
that for side is that some of our
challenges are more just even weather
related so in June I was looking back
through the report and we keep data on
this in June it rained 12 days so um
JP's actually sent me a video of him or
his staff in a tractor while it was
raining they actually have windshield
wipers but um it's challenging for us to
mow when it's wet that's one challenge.
The other is that we also follow a heat
index policy which is it's over 105
correct uh for a heat index then we have
to go indoors and so there was like I
think four days in June so I mean right
there there's almost 20 days of the
month working day I don't know if
they're all working days but anyway
point is is that's another one of our
challenges um and one other story was
interesting and keeping data and all
this and JP might be able to add to this
but Interstate part. Um, a while back we
were studying the data and staff said we
spend 80% of our time there just picking
up trash. I was like, 80% of your time
picking up trash? I mean, how much trash
is there? And they were talking about
all the parking lots and all this. So,
over a period of improvements there,
when we were doing roadway improvements,
we started putting in gates on parking
lots and closing off access to areas
that we ultimately don't need on a
day-to-day basis, only when there's an
event going on. um some of these things
may have changed and JP you could
correct me but I understand now because
of that the trash is reduced so it's all
data studying and it changes all the
time but um that's what JP is good at
and I appreciate all his work so
>> all right thank you so much
>> I have a one quick question or comment I
appreciate what you guys do I know the
bathrooms are hard um some of the
municipalities we work with have like
one park like Tindle at Ben right like
that's their one main park and then they
have the riverside or whatever down the
road. But there
and a few others we go to. Um at first I
thought it was sort of goofy but it was
like you know you go into a gas station
or restaurant and sometimes they'll have
that whiteboard that shows someone's
been in there that day because to your
point your guys could have just left and
then five minutes later sometimes the
Tasmanian Devil comes through there and
it looks like no one's been there for a
month. You know it
that would be and I don't know how to do
it like other than a whiteboard. I'm
sort of simple-minded. But that would be
a nice thing to let people know because
that is a comment I get from people
going everything looks great and the
bathroom looks bad or the mowing, you
know, but if there was some way to sort
of show like someone's been there and I
don't know how to do it, but it would
just be like
>> Yeah. I
>> if if something's green, it's been done
that day or you know it's hadn't been
done yet. Look at that.
>> I don't know. I'm just It's
>> let people know that it's been touched,
right? Like and not
>> Yeah. And it's of course our a lot of
our the other problem we have is a lot
of our restrooms are older. So even when
we go in there with a steam cleaner and
it's you know the metal's rusty and the
the walls even if we paint them are
still a little rough. So it it's it you
know it's it's a perception issue and
you know if there's way I'm going to
look and see if there's something that
we could do with that. You know, the
biggest if we don't encourage people to
write on the walls, and I'm afraid if we
put a whiteboard in there, somebody
might.
>> No, I know. That's what I'm saying.
Maybe it's a color a color flip or
something. You know, just like, you
know,
>> I I had one lady was very upset about a
bathroom being closed and I said, "Well,
it's been vandalized." And she wanted me
to put a camera in there to see who
catched the person. I'm like, I I was,
you know, it's a great idea, but uh I
don't want to go to prison. So, um
>> Okay. Thank you so much. Great great
detail and we appreciate all you do.
>> If you have any questions, feel please
feel free to reach out to me anytime.
>> Hey Shamia, can you turn your camera on
please?
Just want to make sure we can count it
as present.
There she is. Thank you.
Okay. Um let's go into unfinished
business um subcommittee reports. Why
don't we start with uh marketing? Uh
Quinton, if you have anything.
>> I we don't have anything to report this
month.
>> Okay. Uh for uh master planning,
>> I'll I'll speak for that. Leland, uh
we'll do a little bit later.
>> Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead.
>> Leland, Sam, and Canon and I met for a
little bit before this uh meeting. So
one of the processes that exists within
uh parks of w management asset
management is there's a process for
evaluating
properties that you know possibly are
difficult to maintain and and maybe
don't get as much use as we could uh
possibly dispose of and then get um use
that proceeds to to improve or or
procure
an additional property that would get
more use. So, we're considering that for
an area called section 13. And so, the
process is that we recommend that or
parks and recck recommends it to the
city manager and then this once um
they're in line, it kind of comes to the
commission to review, the subcommittee
to review, and then the commission. So,
um, we've gone through that kind of
process and so we would like, uh, to ask
parks and wreck to put together a
presentation for the next meeting to
present, um, section 13 U analysis and
see if we can go from that to recommend
to the board of directors a disposition
for that asset.
>> Anything to add to that, Leland or
Canon? Yeah. One of the things we'd also
ask is the the ordinance
2183
be sent out. It's a public document, but
have it sent out to the commissioners so
that they're
they can ask questions, you know, here
and actually see it ahead of time.
>> So, Simone, can you do that for us? Get
that ordinance and then route it through
Mahogany to distribute to the board so
that they can read it before the next
meeting. I can. What was the ordinance
number again?
>> It's 201183.
>> 20183.
Thank you.
>> Thanks.
>> We need
Ben, can you give the blessing for the
new item next?
>> Yeah, we'll we'll add it to the agenda
items for for next meeting.
>> Yeah. And it would be good to probably
have about 15 minutes, like a five
minute presentation, and then maybe 10
minutes or so for questions and
followup.
Okay. Um, parks conservancy.
>> Um, I was not able to attend the last
parks and conservancy meeting, so I I do
not have an update at this time.
>> I've got one update. It's it's not in
regard. It's somewhat related to parks
conservancy about the golf annual golf
thing we were going to try to do this
July. I've been talking to Mike Ingram.
He's the pro the head pro at Redsman and
we decided to either postpone it till
this fall or postpone it till next
summer. This raises money for the summer
playground program. Um,
I would like to I'll probably pose it to
put in the agenda items for next month,
but Mike can do everything. He can
prepare everything, but we he just he
needs our help as far as getting teams
and uh get maybe getting some sponsors
um
because he only got one team uh for this
for this month and we just decided to
postpone it. And so I will I'll put that
in the agenda for for next month is to
to discuss timing for the parts golf
tournament benefiting summer playground
program. So
um
commission ideas. I think this has been
on unfinished business for a while. I um
I don't I think we kind of talked about
that earlier this year. Can we take that
off of unfinished business? Is that just
>> We can. The reason that I've uh left it
on it's because uh to make sure that uh
you guys have time to discuss it
ongoing. I thought it was an ongoing
item um because you can't discuss well
you're not supposed to be
>> discussing it when you do your quarterly
visits. So yeah.
>> Um but I you know whatever uh is good
for the order.
>> Okay. I think we can just take it off
since we're um mid year 2025 and we've
already kind of talked about what we're
doing for for this year. Um if you don't
mind doing that.
>> Not at all.
>> Thank you, Mahogany.
Um so tomorrow is the uh second
site visit at West Central Ballfield. I
think uh be great to get to able to
maybe get a sneak peek of the ball field
before the grand opening next week. I I
will definitely be there. Um I can pick
up some waters if we if we're going to
go be outside, but uh just maybe a show
of hands or if talk if who will all be
there tomorrow.
>> We got Leland.
>> Okay. Okay.
I don't think it's going to I don't
think we're going to it's going to be
like the MacArthur Park um where we're
going to be going somewhere afterward.
But, uh, I think I'm I'm very
interested. I never been to West
Central, so curious to see what what
that looks like, especially the new ball
field. So, we'll be at 400 pm tomorrow,
and I'll pick up just maybe a have a
nice chest of water if we do end up kind
of walking outside a little bit.
Um, onboarding for new commissioners and
subcommittee assignments.
Um, they the new three uh was it three
or two commissioners?
three commissioners are I think we'll
probably be starting next month. Um
and I think we're I don't as far as
subcommittee assignments I think we need
to talk to them and see what their
interests are next month. Um if that's
okay. Simone, I don't know what the
process or where they start next month
or will be September. Does it depend on
when the Taylor Up board of directors
votes on it?
>> It depends on when the city of Little
Rock uh board of directors votes on it.
They have not yet met for that. So if
they take that up next week, then it
would be the following month generally
speaking or like whatever meeting
happens after it's approved by the
board.
>> Okay.
Um
Okay. I don't think we have anything to
add, I guess, for for that agenda item.
Um summer playground. Do we have any
updated numbers from anyone here just
about how it's going or I know we got
last month we got a number of the amount
of people who are who were doing it as
far as attendees but I don't know if
anyone has any update on that
>> and just report real quick Shwanda Craig
who would be able to report on that and
would be here to do that is actually out
um of the office today um on personal
leave. So, um I know that summer
playground the the camp is going well
and uh the numbers are are good. Um I
know there's some numbers in in the
report, but um and definitely make sure
she's here next next month to uh give a
report.
>> Okay.
Um Little Rock Open update. This was the
of course the tennis tournament that
occurs um I guess in June of at Resin
Park. I think we talked about it last
month. I don't know if anyone has an
update on that, but I think it was
discussed last month.
Okay. Um I think this is uh an ongoing
parts fundraiser. I think this was we
talked about this post the fundraiser
for reservoir.
Um, you know, I think we really, and I'm
not in the parks conservancy meetings,
but that's of course the nonprofit arm
that helps raises money for for things
uh regarding the parks. Um, but you
know, we we're going to talk about the
golf tournament next month. Of course,
we did that for Reservoir Park, but um
any updates or anyone have any comments
about how we can provide a parts
fundraiser?
Um, Leila, I think the of course the the
Marathon Dust Produce is a probably a
big fundraiser for for parts. Um,
any anything else to add regarding
fundraisers in general or anyone on the
on the commission have any ideas? I'm
not sure what brought this about, but
I'm just um
>> I can I can just share real quick.
Little Rock Marathon for 23 plus years
has been very supportive of the parks
department. They that's their goal is to
fund raise money and raise money for the
the department. Um this year they did
give us um $50,000 towards Reservoir
Park and the conservancy did host a
fundraiser event for Reservoir Park and
they raised some additional funds on top
of that. So that might be where this um
line item came from a little bit about
discussing that we were having an
ongoing fundraiser for reservoir and and
other things. Um but happy to you know
share other ideas for fundraisers but um
those are some of our biggest ones and
we appreciate what the marathon does for
us. Do
>> those funds go are they targeted for
anything or do they just kind of go
general to however you want to
>> from the marathon?
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. So the marathon always reaches out
and asks for our most recent needs. Uh
so in the past let's say they they gave
money uh funds to the Murray Park
playground that was added down there.
They've given money to the MacArthur
Park playground. Some of those are the
most recent ones. This uh last one was
for Reservoir Park for the playground
that we are working to replace there. Um
so typically they just ask us what what
our needs are and I try to put them put
that money towards some bigger asset
that we're trying to accomplish. Um but
there's never just a it's not always the
same distinct, you know, distinct. It's
also not always the same number as well.
during COVID marathon went down in
numbers so there was less money. I think
generally speaking over their uh history
they've given something almost like $2
million or something to the department
for different projects. So um that would
be a whole another you know kind of
report opportunity or presentation from
the Little Rock Marathon at some point
if if we wanted to get in more depth of
that. So
>> thanks.
>> Okay. Um uh the next agenda item is the
is a photo of themselves. I I've been to
a number of parts the past month that
have not done that. Um so I guess uh has
anyone done that yet, Graham? Okay.
Well, we will just make it a point if
you uh even if you're just driving by
can stop by for five minutes, but um
just if you're at a park or drive near a
park, just and I do remember that as
well to uh take a photo of
of yourself.
>> I'm just going to interrupt and say you
will have a prime opportunity to do that
tomorrow.
>> There you go.
>> Thank you, sir.
>> Fair enough.
>> Okay. Um before we get into new
business, a bit of news. Um we need to
add a new agenda item uh to accept the
resination of JT Firstl u from the
commission. Um he has he's got a lot
going on uh with his work. He he leads a
business and doesn't he can devote the
time and attention uh it deserves to to
meet. So can I get a motion to add an
agenda item under new business to accept
the motion of JT first resignation?
>> U motion.
>> Can I get a second?
>> Second.
>> Okay. So since we're talking about it,
we'll just go ahead and make that number
one under new business. Can I get a
motion to accept JT Firstl's uh
resation acceptance?
>> A motion to whatever you just said.
>> You're an attorney.
>> That's good enough.
>> Can I get a second?
>> Second.
>> Okay, that's been accepted. Uh JT First
um resignation has been accepted.
>> We need a vote on those after the
seconds. Oh,
>> okay. Can we uh have a vote of all those
in favor of JT Firstl's resignation say
I
>> I. All those opposed.
>> And can we have a vote for the motion to
add it to the agenda, please?
>> Can we have a vote to add the motion to
the new business of JT first
resignation? All those in favor say I.
>> I.
>> I. That's okay.
>> I
>> sorry.
>> May I ask what what is the process to uh
he was vice chair. So, do we can we add
a process in there to bring back a um
nominate a new vice chair?
>> Yes. Um let me grab your bylaws real
quick.
>> Thank you.
>> Um while she's doing that, um this is
kind of out of order, but I was down at
Interstate Park. I guess it was like
three weeks ago and it was like 8:30 at
night and the lights weren't coming on
in the softball field and somebody was
down there from parks and they called
everybody in their entire phone book
stayed until the lights came on and I
just wanted to say kudos. I wrote his
name down but now I've forgotten it, you
know, but uh he did a great job and I
just wanted to say that was really nice.
He didn't have to do all that. You know,
it's like nine o'clock at night. So,
>> appreciate that comment. We have added a
uh very recently a new system to um be
able to do that from our phones to those
but the challenge there is those lights
are uh very antiquated and that's
another challenge that we have with some
of our assets but um hopefully going
forward that won't be the problem but
>> um thank you for that comment. I'm glad
that our staff were there to help out.
Uh the bylaws do allow and typically it
would be the first meeting of the year,
but obviously we need a vice chair now.
So you can go ahead and make that you
can nominate someone and uh vote on them
now if you'd like or you could move that
to the next meeting. It's however you'd
prefer. Um but if you and I would say
that if like if we had a definite date
that the new commissioners were coming
on, we could say we could definitely say
let's go ahead and save the table that.
if you we don't have that information.
So if you just want to go with what you
have now, you can make that decision as
well.
>> Um
>> yeah, I'll be I should
>> also I'll just add we do not there is a
process for having a temporary chair if
we need to. So there there's no problem
there if like we don't have commissioner
France one day chairperson France I'm
sorry
>> feel so valuable
[Laughter]
>> um
>> it does not have to be today I'm sorry
>> well I don't know who is interested in
being vice chair
but if anyone is can they speak up and
say or should we just do it and That's
my up.
>> If you're interested, you could speak
up. If you want to take some time to
think about it, we can table this and
move it to next month.
>> Okay. So, if you have any interest,
please speak up. If not, we can table it
to next month.
>> I mean, I'm interested. I'd be
interested in doing that, but
>> Okay. Do we have any other people
interested?
>> I'll make a motion to nominate Quinton
as vice chair.
We have a second.
>> Second.
>> All those in favor of Quinnim Quinton
becoming vice chair, say I.
>> I.
>> I or whatever.
>> All opposed.
>> All right. Someone can do that. Okay.
>> Congratulations.
[Applause]
>> A lot of drama. Yeah.
>> All right. Congrats. Um, so now I won't
be I won't be here next month.
[Laughter]
Uh anyway,
>> uh the next um order of new business is
parts commission vacancy appointment
update. I think we do I guess since JT
resigned we do have a vacancy but I
guess that has to go through all the
city rules and reds. Um but they as
Simone mentioned once city board has to
approve the nominations of us they can't
start until we do that. And so I guess
that's just put that in new business. I
don't I don't know what else to talk
about in that, but I guess that'll be a
new business next month.
>> So, we've got three nominations that
they're going to vote on. Do we need to
request a list of
candidates for this new vacancy?
>> Well, I think they had the application
up on the website first.
>> So, uh if you
>> go ahead.
>> Yes, the three that are pending are
already pending and we are waiting for
the board. We will get the whole new
proc the whole process started again. We
will collect the applications that we
have from the city manager's office and
then we will bring them to you guys to
discuss. You can nominate and we'll
bring to the board again. And
>> ideally we should have that for you next
meeting
>> so that if it has not happened before
next meeting then we can do it all at
one meeting and that will be covered.
>> Okay.
Uh new business. It says presentation
list discussion selection for next
meeting. I don't
>> I'm not sure what this is to be honest
with you. I don't
>> I don't think we needed extra
presentation since we're having one uh
on the asset management.
>> I believe I added that or we discussed
adding that last month so that we have
something for presentations,
>> but if to Canon's point, if we're having
a presentation about section 13,
>> it would be the board's decision to have
another one or not. So,
>> okay,
>> I would recommend not just so we can
focus it. That should actually be a good
conversation and hopefully a lot of
questions and answers. So,
>> can you
can you send us that actually ordinance
so we can look at it and review it
before um before next month, but yeah, I
I agree. I mean, one one presentation is
probably good for next month,
>> but I' I'd love to leave that on new
business just so it reminds us to pro
every time
>> um agenda items for next meeting. We've
already talked about the presentation
regarding uh land disposition and um
that ordinance. And then I mentioned
maybe just to have a quick discussion
about the golf tournament on when it
needs to be held, whether it's this
fall, whether it's next summer, but as I
said, Mike uh Mike Ingram at Resmond
will do all the work. We just have to
help market it and get teams there. So,
any other agenda items for next month? I
think we have a pretty good solid
um solid list for next month in August.
>> Um I have a question about the um
golf tournament uh discussion on the
agenda. Does Mike Ingram need to be here
for that?
>> Um
no. I think this is and I talked to him
yesterday. I think this is I think it's
the commission deciding do we want to
have this in the fall or in the or that
summer and then I can get with Mike to
discuss specific dates. Um,
>> I think it's just discussing that. So, I
don't think he needs to be there.
>> So,
I don't think any the board is here. Um,
I do want to give a shout out to JP.
That was an awesome presentation, man.
Thank you for doing that. Learned a lot.
Um, congrats to Quinton for being by
share. anything
about parts or about next month that you
guys want to talk about before we
adjourn?
>> I have two two items in a comment. One,
I wanted to double check uh for Rebmen
sort of buried in in there is a dates
confirmed for a thousand player pickle
ball tournament. It says next fall,
October 10th to 12th, but then it says
2025. Is that this fall or 2026? And it
was a typo. I just don't know.
I can verify that. So, uh we were
working with um a pickle the pickle ball
you would know the was the
>> profession yes professional pickle ball
association. They had reached out to um
us and the little rock CVB to host a uh
tournament at our resin tennis uh
facility. Uh we were working with them
on having that at that date and as just
recent um they had sent us a contract
which the Little Rock CVB did not want
to sign because of different clauses in
it and I'm not an attorney. So I pass
that on to our city attorney to review
and see if we would want to sign it.
Before I got comments back from our city
attorney, I understood that they had
moved locations to the athletic club, I
believe.
>> Yeah, I think the athletic club,
>> the Little Rock Athletic Club, which has
some new uh pickle ball facilities. Um,
somebody might ask if they're watching,
well, how how are they going to play
pickle ball at Resmond Tennis because we
don't have pickle ball there. Just to
clarify that they were actually uh
proposing to do some temporary striping
and then we were going to resurface one
court for the championship game and then
we re resurfaced it back. Um I don't
know if that was a deterrent as well. Um
I was very supportive of it and sad to
see that it didn't work out but um
that's where that stands.
>> Okay. I I just wasn't sure. I was going
to say that's a big event, right? you
know. Um, and then one of the the other
item uh was at the top of the
administration said departments
addressing spending needs, goals, and
object objectives for the 2026 budget. I
know we talked about this like months
ago, but um
maybe not next month, but the following
can at some point like when you all feel
comfortable swinging us into the
what are goals and objectives that you
guys are looking to do or you know what
I so that we can
>> uh like when Ben gave the presentation,
we're hoping to give one earlier in the
year to the city board and the the
public in general, you know, saying,
"Hey, here's the objectives of parks and
wreck, right?" Like so that it's a a
kickoff kind of thing.
>> Yeah. So, I'm I'm glad you brought that
up, uh, Canon. So um our budget process
um has has just started and um it I mean
officially it hasn't started but we're
we are starting it in August. I mean we
just got some direction on it last week
and so um staff and I are meeting in the
coming weeks to determine some of the
analysis that we need for what you were
just mentioning goals, objectives,
accomplishments. Um we're doing it
slightly earlier this year than um than
expected, but that's fine. That's good.
And so we will have a lot of that
information compiled in August. And so I
believe we could I could give a quick
briefing on that if you wanted to add
that to an agenda item next month. Um
and just since we're talking about
budget and stuff, there has been a
request for us to look at how we can
look at red reducing our budget
slightly. Um, and that's just from a
standpoint of operation dollars and
stuff like that. And we're just going
through that process. And so our staff
will have uh our team will have some
recommendations across the board on
potentially how we can do that. Um,
nothing has been decided. All that will
be decided by the mayor and city board.
So um, but we could definitely start
sharing some of that information here.
that could get, you know, very lengthy
very quickly, but um definitely a bit,
you know, able to give a little update
next month. But great question.
>> Sorry for the followup, but I would
assume it's a citywide they're asking
every department head or chair to look
at.
>> Yes, it's a conversation just to look
generally speaking, is there any savings
we can do across the city? I mean, it's
it's it's not unheard of. It's something
we look at all the time. Uh sometimes
there might be uh some other funds um
where we where we're not looking at
reducing maybe and um I just understand
it's a little bit of where the economy
is and all kinds of different scenarios
and so that's what we're doing today. So
>> okay.
>> All right. I think with that hopefully 7
tomorrow at 4 p.m. at West Central
meeting is adjourned.
>> Thank you.
>> Hold on. Hold on. Oh,
>> we are ending before our scheduled one
o'clock time. So, we need a motion,
please.
>> Okay.
Uh, can I get a motion to end the
meeting at 12:48
49?
>> Uh, motion.
>> Second.
>> Second.
>> All those in favor?
>> I I
>> Is that always the case? Because we've
been early before.
>> Okay.
Nbertbert.
>> No, you're good. No, I'm just curious.
