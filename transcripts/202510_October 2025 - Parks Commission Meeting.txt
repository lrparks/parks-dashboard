>> Second.
>> All in favor say I.
>> I.
>> I.
>> All opposed.
Okay. Looks like the meeting minutes
have um been approved uh for September.
The next uh item on the agenda is
citizen communication. We had someone
from the Heyman Park Community
Neighborhood Association stopped by this
morning, the president, and she uh she I
guess she got here too early and so she
just decided to write this note down
that should be uh on top of your
packets, but I'm going to go ahead and
read it. Uh on behalf of the Heyman Park
Community Neighborhood Association, its
president, Miss Terry Reynolds, and
residents, we approve of the design plan
that has been presented to us at our
last neighborhood association meeting.
We are we are excited about making our
park a more inviting place to visit, not
only for the residents, but for visitors
from around the city, state, and out of
town guests. At the same time, we would
At the same time, we would like our
existing grounds to be continued,
maintained, upgraded, and manicured.
Thank you for loving our part in keeping
us a breast of the completed plans,
construction, and timeline.
Okay. Well, thank you, uh, Miss
Reynolds, for uh, voicing your opinion
about um, Hyman Park. We appreciate it.
Okay, as I mentioned, um in your packet,
you have a
uh you have the meeting minutes as well
as the staff reports. Um is there any
questions u from the staff reports? Um
well, I guess let's hand it over to
Leland. Le will go over his report and
then ask about any questions on staff
reports.
>> Sure. Yes. I'd love to start with staff
reports. Are there any staff questions
from the uh commissioners today?
>> Um do you have an I I read the update on
um Revsman Golf Course? Um I've heard a
lot of good things recently from Resmond
Golf Course that they're getting people
in and out of there and that the course
is in great condition. Is is that what
you're hearing as well?
>> Actually, yes. Not so much um about the
getting in and out. There's still been
some questions about scheduling and and
a little bit of of that, but we have
worked more on that. Um but on the in
terms in terms of maintenance of the
course, yes, we have great staff and a
great uh new leadership down there to um
handle those things. And so uh yes, I've
heard some of the similar um uh
comments. So, thank you for sharing
that.
>> Quick question. Um, and I ran into this
in another city recently, but the
unsheltered or unhoused work orders
receive four calls, zero cleanups. Like,
is it you all's
somebody else helps
the unsheltered people find a different
spot and then you all have to clean up
if there's debris left over? What's sort
of the protocol? In Tulsa, it was like
parks and rec responsibility to do it
all and they were always on. Yeah,
>> overwhelmed. So, I just don't know what
the
>> Justin might have to correct me here,
but I'll I'll I'll start and you tell me
if I get off on this, but we have a we
definitely have a policy and there's a
day process and all this, but we do uh
have a um another group in the city and
it's led by Mata Matthew Davo and he
handles all of our unsheltered
population and our challenges there. In
terms of us directly in terms of parks,
if we come across one, we have a time
frame of what is it?
>> 72 hours. So, we we have to mark it by
posting a sign that says this
information about, you know, you're not
supposed to be here and all this
depending on where it is or what they're
doing. Um, and that's if they're more or
less camping in a park. Um, and so then
we go through that process working with
Little Rock PD and and Matthew and our
staff. So, we definitely have a process.
What was the stat that you have? I don't
know if I'm current on that.
>> It said four calls received, but zero
camp cleanups and that may be accurate.
I just don't I just hadn't seen it
before. So, I was just curious what the
process.
>> So, I don't I couldn't tell you of any
active camps that that staff have been
working on.
>> Okay.
>> So, typically there's something and so,
you know, an issue or a challenge
somewhere and I don't I think that's
changed just I'm not sure why. So,
>> okay. Now that this summer we were
having a lot of issues around splash
pads and fully gated courts. People were
using them.
>> Yeah. You were in other
>> in other areas. Yeah. Not here, but in
Tulsa. It was pretty bizarre. I mean,
they were having to shut off water
>> at water parks or splash pads cuz people
were using it to bathe. So, I just
didn't know like what
>> Yes.
>> You know, you guys were having
interesting.
Um, I had another question about um
youth soccer in the city. I think people
play I play over there by um right
behind Town Pump or Rice Barbecue.
There's like a little open field.
>> Yes.
>> Not me personally. My kid soccer.
>> My kid my kid does. Um
>> but some of the other parents they play
I think they call it at Murray Park.
There's some fields over there and
they've talked to me a lot about the
antills like they're like dodging
antills and they like hey I heard you're
on the parks and commission. I was like
oh thanks for whoever spread that. But
um what's what's kind of the um protocol
for Ant Hills or how do they
>> Yeah, I'll just share this is that we
have a um ongoing 25 year lease with
United Soccer. Um now they're um rising
if you've heard them of different names.
They've been they were also originally
Riverdale. Anyway, they um have a lease
an active lease over Murray, those two
fields as well as Natural Steps. Um it's
definitely a work progress for us both.
I mean, but they are responsible for the
maintenance of the fields. Um, we do do
a lot of like uh irrigation and some
other help and stuff like that. Um, but
I also will say, and I'm not trying to
just say it's all them. I mean, ants for
us, I was in war moral park the other
day walking. They're everywhere.
>> I mean, and and we can put out some
different baits or different things and
Justin could speak more to that, but
that there's not a simple solution
that's just going to make the ants go
away. if there was, we would definitely
be working with Rising to to achieve
that. Um, but um, and if somebody has if
somebody's watching or or if you know
somebody that has a solution,
>> share it. But um, we definitely would
need to work with um, United Soccer to
do that as well.
>> Perfect. Thank you.
>> Yeah. And so I would recommend they they
reach out to United Soccer as well. I
mean, they're they're the ones paying
United Soccer to be there.
>> I know.
Right.
>> One more question on the recreation
division. Um said Southwest after school
had two students enrolled. Is
was that the expectation or is there
>> Yeah, I'd have ask Shaw to come speak to
that.
>> Good afternoon everyone.
>> Good afternoon. in the southwest area
there are a lot of um after school
programs that are free and that provide
transportation. So that is one of the
barriers that we're um facing um due to
transportation cuz we don't provide
transportation. But last year we started
a pilot program to try to see how many
students we can get uh to come to our
after school program from the Lacy
school and that will be the only
location where we will provide
transportation is at the Lacy school. So
we're still trying to get the word out
and so that's why the the number is
really low there.
>> Okay. Okay. I was just
jumped off the page at me, so I was
curious.
>> Yes,
>> that's good. I appreciate the the
questions. Anything else at this time?
Okay. So, I have several agenda or not
so much agenda items, but things to
cover. Um, and so I'm going to go
through a lot of them relatively
quickly, but please stop me um if I move
on to the next one uh with any questions
or concerns or comments. Um so the the
department continues to go through our
our operating budget and our planning uh
budget for 2026. Um we uh will continue
to update the uh city board and we don't
have anything
um exactly scheduled currently that I'm
aware of, but that will be ongoing. So,
I share that to say if anybody in this
process has any other questions or more
feedback on our budget throughout the
the rest of the year, this would be a
good time to discuss it. Uh, is it just
going to be plus or minus 3% from last
year? Any major changes? Do you know of
you think?
>> That's not my decision. That that would
be a city board, mayor, city manager.
So, um
>> I would I would say stay tuned to the um
the rest of the year's budget meeting. I
mean, not budget meetings, board
meetings, and
>> um they will um assuming we start
discussing those um budgets more. I know
that they were waiting on a number on
several different services for the city,
you know, for what they have to budget
for next year, and I think they've uh
accomplished most of that now. So, um,
one thing I wanted to share, a project
I've put a lot of time on, uh, been a
very, um, great project is the 30
crossing, uh, park master plan. If
anybody has any questions on that or any
clarifications, uh, we did a great, uh,
public input session, uh, down at the,
uh, food truck festival and another one
in in Uler, uh, building down there at
the River Market Avenue. Um, so we've we
got on our, uh, public uh, input. We
also had an online survey. Um we've
gotten over 2,000 3,000 responses. Um so
um that project is going on and we'll
our consultants Sasaki and Associates
will uh finish those plans. Um and then
be preparing to present something final
before the end of this year. Um so I'm
really excited about that. Um you know
there there might be an opportunity at
some point to share those plans or
however this board would like to see
that. But that's definitely a big
project that we've spent a lot of time
and effort on. Um
there's also um Karen's here, but she'll
talk about her uh big volunteer event at
Hyman Park, which was happened this last
month. There's several of us that went
to national conference in Orlando. I
came back very inspired. I've been
pushing a lot of new things. Um and uh
learned a lot down there and some of our
staff did as well. We also uh went to a
Port Smith conference, a state
conference. Um I don't know how many of
us went. I think Angela was it 18 of us.
So we had a really good turnout there
and um that is a higher number for us,
but that was because we um and in fact
I'll ask Shawanda to come speak to that.
So Shaw was a real adamant about us
applying for some awards and we received
three awards as the department and so
because of that we invited a lot of our
additional staff to come up and
participate in that award program and
that banquet and so Shaw was the was the
real leader of that campaign. If you
would just share the three awards real
quick.
>> Okay. Yes, we won um three awards at the
Arkansas Recreation Parks Association
conference. Uh we won the festival and
event of the year five years five to 10
year uh our star student after school um
program and banquet that we hold every
year. Also number two uh outdoor
facility of the year 200,000 to 500,000
was our uh resident tennis facility and
our young professional of the year was
Christian Robels
>> and also I became an executive member
board member of the um ARPA I'm the
treasurer.
>> Congrats.
>> Awesome. What's the um is Christian
Rebels? What what is
>> Christian Robels? He's our youth sports
coordinator.
>> Okay.
>> He was a previous um recreation program
at West Central. He got promoted to our
youth sports coordinator.
>> That's awesome. And then the 200,000 500
is that like revenue per year?
>> Yes.
>> Okay.
>> Great.
>> Those were the categories.
>> Then would you share briefly about Joe
and his uh award that he received at
national conference?
>> Okay. Uh Joe Guzman is our new
recreation program coordinator. He um he
spoke at the national conference. Um he
had about 175 people to attend his class
in in Orlando. Uh he also spoke at the
ARPA conference. Um and he did receive
his uh certification for um certified
recreation and parks professional.
>> Nice. Awesome.
>> Congrats. Okay.
>> A lot of talented people here.
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah. And then one other certification
I'd like to this is for maintenance.
This is uh
>> JP Rogers our maintenance manager under
Justin um
>> he is now our lead in certification is
he so we we all strive to get a CPRP
which is a certified
parks and recreation professional. Uh
but you can add an E to that and be an
executive and JP has uh achieved that.
He's our first in our department.
Anyway, I really promote and push uh
certifications and continuing education
and so uh we are achieving some of those
and um would like to share that for all
those people. So anyway um moving on um
just wanted to share a lot of things
that we have in procurement bids,
contracts, everything that y'all need to
be aware of. Um, I've been very adamant
to get um, a lot of private partners
this year. And I'm just going to run
down this list and then y'all can circle
back and ask me if there's any
questions. But on Otter Creek Soccer
Fields, we have a current um, bid out to
have a a group to manage soccer out
there. And so it's an RFP. East Little
Rock. I have a RFB that will start on
1013 uh to go out for finding another
user for that facility andor grounds uh
to make it even have more um use of the
facility. Uh we feel like it's
underutilized. Uh the budget was pulled
out of that a long time ago and that's a
a longer story. Interstate park is the
same. We have a RFP that we put out, the
city put out and we're working to try to
finalize for not the ball fields but for
two soccer football fields that have
been underutilized. We also put out an
RFI for golf enterprise um anything in
terms of War Memorial First um Resmond
uh looking at requests for information.
I believe that's currently out or as it
it might have almost already closed. Um
there there had been some interest in um
private residents um operating golf or
some some ability to operate golf at war
moral and so uh this allows them to uh
send us something uh professionally and
and submittal for us to review. Um
section 13 is still on our list. Uh we
do have a legal opinion um which um has
just been finalized. So, I'm hopeful I
will be working with Simone, but I'm
hopeful to be able to do a public
hearing um roughly this time next month
at this meeting. Um but we haven't
confirmed that. So,
um and then um at the board level, we
just approved um the CPRG grant, which
is a roughly half million dollar grant
for new trees for Reservoir and Murray
Park. Uh really exciting to be able to
get that back. We'll be bidding.
Justin's been working on a new design
for the ball field at Reservoir Park.
So, that will be coming online as well,
as well as some several playground
updates. Southside playground,
Riverfront playground, and Murray Park
playground are all playgrounds that
we're either adding or making
improvements or or replacing due to
safety concerns or life cycle. Um, we
also just completed an annual purchase
order bid for our pool service
contracts, um, which uh is working on
for her facilities, for her pools. Um,
those are just some of our current
things that I needed to be able to, you
know, get in front of you all and let us
know of any, um, questions or follow-ups
that you might have on any of those
subject matters. And that concludes my
report for commission
>> on the question.
>> Oh, sorry.
>> I was just saying any questions. Go
ahead.
>> On the 30 crossing, I'm still confused.
We talked about it I think earlier this
year, but um how is it getting funded or
this concept design being funded? Is
that from the city or
>> Sure.
>> convention center convention?
>> No, I'll kind of go even farther back
than that. So, in June of 2024, we had a
downtown master plan that was um
completed and it was a master plan
looking at the entire downtown. It was
it was a $750,000 project that was
funded by COVID ARPA funds, American
relief uh funds. Um in that there there
was a uh one of the big first steps of
looking at improving downtown as part of
the master plan was developing a uh park
on this 18 acres that was provided
because of the reconstruction of the I30
uh interstate.
Um, so, uh, as a city, we had additional
ARPA funds remaining for cert certain
projects like that that could be
utilized for downtown. Um, I I wasn't in
every little bit of discussion of all
those funding mechanisms, but that's my
understanding is that so we use ARPA
funds for the master plan for the
downtown uh, not only the downtown
master plan, but also for the 30
crossing. So the 30 crossing uh started
in end of 2024 in terms of a selection
process and and picking the team. Uh
there were a lot of local um
subconsultant companies uh that we've
utilized and um as well as Sasaki who is
the overarching and so that's where that
was funded from in terms of I think your
question Canon was how are we going to
fund it in the future um in terms of
construction I guess right? Well, the
even the history so I
>> Yeah. So, um the project that has been
designed to date as far as it's been
designed is a 60 to90 million rough
project. Um which is actually don't
laugh. I mean that that's a smaller
budget than what typically you would
probably see on that size acreage,
right? And especially for your downtown
of a city of our size and all these
different criteria. However, due to the
fact that it's AR dot property, your
existing AR dot property is going to
stay AR dot property, there are a lot of
different constraints and opportunities
based on that. And so, um, I'm not going
to get into all the detail there. That's
that's a whole another conversation, but
more or less, we're not going to be able
to build a building or a retail building
or something like that, which is what
reduces that overall cost. Um, there are
grants and different things like that.
We've already applied with the state. um
and ARDOT as partnerships for a bill
grant and that's um something that's
ongoing in terms of and that would
provide roughly $25 million. Um but you
know realistically at the end of the day
it's going to be a partnership of trying
to figure out in my opinion and my my
leadership is trying to figure out how
do we build a partnership around all the
agencies around it. There's there's I
think there's roughly about a handful or
eight of them that all had a real part
or interest in utilizing this space. So,
it's it's that and then figuring out a
um an actual governance board that would
actually operate this park, which would
be a little bit different than any other
park we have. So, it' actually be like a
foundation and a board and an executive
uh leadership. At least this is what our
master plan committee and stakeholders
have determined. um is a is a real uh
way that they would like to go about it
because of the cost of the project and
ongoing and because of where we stand as
a department and parks now with other
questions. Typically the next question
here is when when are we going to do
something with war moral park or
something like that. So I'll just cut to
the chase is I mean that that's the
challenge and so you know we have a lot
of uh uh opportunities in a lot of
different parks and this is a really big
one that um you know we had the
opportunity and and we've made the plan
now we got to keep and finish it. So um
hopefully that answered your questions.
>> Yeah. No, I was Yeah, just curious
overall. Yeah. So,
>> we're not sitting on, you know, $70
million.
>> I I assume that. Yeah.
>> But Leland,
excuse me. Did you say how many acres it
is the entire
>> So, 30 crossing is um you'll hear a lot
of different acres and every meeting I'm
in, everybody kind of gives a different
different number. It originally started
out as 15 acres and it went to 18 and
now that's 19. The reason of that is is
because really the AR dot property I
believe is is approximately 15 acres.
Okay. And if you include the rideways or
the streets and all these different
things, the green space is 15 acres.
We've also in the plan included all the
way down uh under I30 down to the
Arkansas River and then expanded it or
not even expanded it but took in the um
the green space in front of the nature
center and to the east of the uh first
security amphitheater. So, there's
actually some city property there, uh,
which we can handle differently. Um, and
you know, just getting talking about it,
it gets me excited to be able to share
the the plans with y'all at some point.
So, um, we should figure that out as
well. Um, but that that's the breakdown
of the property.
>> But when you add all of the other green
space in front of the library,
>> yes. So, um,
>> how many acres is that?
>> I know what you're headed toward. So if
you take um roughly the 30 33 acres of
riverfront park, let's say the 20 acres
for 30 crossings, so that's 50 acres.
The Clinton Library now is approximately
50 acres which is city parkland as well.
And so now downtown collectively all in
this one area including the Bill Clark
wetland in the highlands and all this
that are under our park you know
management is um approximately 100 acres
of of continuous parkland in downtown
Little Rock. So
>> that's what I wanted you to say. Thank
you. It's big. It's huge.
>> Yeah.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you. And that was when you
mentioned the
the uh is it the Stevens
wildlife
building that's down there?
>> The nature center. Yes.
>> In one of the drawings it looked like it
was gone or did I just miss where it was
placed on one of the drawings?
>> If you're referring to some of the the
renderings um it you know in fact one of
the renderings there's a climbing tower
that blocks majority of the building.
Um, and so you might not see it. And in
fact, I actually interesting you brought
that detail up. I asked him in one of
those renderings. I said, "You just, you
know, show the building a little bit so
people can get that understanding of
that known location." So, we kind of
cheated a little bit so you can see the
back of the build or the side of the
building. But yes, very good uh detail.
>> I noticed it and a couple people were
like, "Are they just destroying the
building?" I was like, "No, not in
fact." Game and Fish was one of the um
uh groups that was very interested in
utilizing the green space and we
developed a archery lawn area and a lawn
area that they could use not just for
archery but for other multi-purpose uses
that um the nature center there is a is
a oneoff for their facilities. Normally
a nature center is in the smack dab of
of nature as an urban environment and so
they're really excited um to um partner
with us to you know develop this out
more and and program it too. So which is
great.
>> And then the last you know I ask
questions. The last one is when you were
talking I was thinking it's headless and
then towards the end you said there be a
board or something. So is it going to be
set off in theory or the way it's laid
out now similar to like the river market
has its sort of own
operating structure that's under you
guys but not really under parks and
wreck but not really like how
>> yeah
at this point. Yeah, the difference
there is the River Market is actually
leased by the parks department through
the city to Little Rock CVB and Little
Rock CVB manages the River Market Hall
and they program and do all that. So,
that's really more of a typical
management type lease,
>> like a lease back or
>> Yeah. Um what what the the um the
professional here um the group that has
been working us through this whole
process said from their experience
throughout the country where these parks
have been really successful in this size
you know size and downtown urban core is
to have an actual executive committee
and I don't have the official
terminology of it yet and and I don't
know who is going to actually be the
lead of all that but that's that's the
direction we're driving and trying to
figure out right now is to have
essentially you might even have like a
paid executive director from, you know,
revenue sources or from private dollars,
right? Or from and
what they often say is like a a diverse
capital stack, right?
And so, you know, whatever that stack of
money would look like, we really need
somebody that can help manage that as
well as have a board of of individuals
that are stakeholders in it. Um, I've
just recognized that, you know, the
parks department alone with the budget
that we have and the manpower we have
are not going to be able to pick up
another, you know, size project like
this. And we really want to find
somebody that can help us with that and
and and run it. as part of the downtown
master plan. There was originally um one
of the goals or the you know the agenda
items in that for the master plan for
the downtown area was to develop a um
park foundation. Um, and I know
everybody here knows we have a current
park foundation, but um, anyway, there's
been discussion, well, does that mean
just for the 30 crossing or is that for
all downtown parks? And we're working
through all that as well. And those, but
>> it's all good recommendations and trying
to figure it all out. So,
>> gotcha. So, similar to like St. Louis,
how they have like the horse park
foundation that
>> I would assume. Yes. Yeah.
>> Manages and, you know, fundraises and
all that.
>> And we have other groups like that. I
mean, somebody might reference like the
MacArthur Park Group, but that's they're
they're not official in any capacity.
So, the biggest difference here would be
is finding that official aspect of it
and then actually having, you know, a
vast array of stakeholders that are
really, you know, on this board or in
this committee, however that works out.
So,
>> thank you. Yeah, thank you.
>> All right. Um, let's move on. Uh, Gabby,
anything on your end or or Graham on the
events?
Um, yeah, we have a couple of events
this Saturday. Uh, there's the Billiards
tournament at Southwest Community Center
and Salsa Festival at uh, West Central
Community Center. Salsa Festival is at
12:00 p.m. Billiards is at 10:00 a.m.
Um, so those are coming up. Kicking it
at Kanes is what we've um, sort of
shifted. the basketball tournament that
we talked about a month or two ago.
We've shifted to more of a uh we
partnered with director Lewis with her W
6 block party and made it sort of more
of a holistic event. Um so it's going to
be all throughout the park. There's
going to be
uh 30 plus vendors. Um, we're going to
be utilizing the pickle ball courts, the
skate park, the playground. We'll have
bounce houses as well as basketball
tournament, um, and food trucks and
things. So, that's November 1st from
10 to 2 for the block party. And I think
the basketball starts at 9.
Um, and then we have Marathon has the
creep and crawl race on October 18th
and that's a 5k and half marathon I
believe.
>> Any question?
>> You go, Gabby. Okay.
>> Um,
>> I'd like to add Yeah. one comment.
>> Um, so if you've been by War Memorial
Park, I've I've received several
questions. Uh, what what is all the
yellow flagging in the park? Uh, if you
go down mark them. Um, so don't be
alarmed. It's not some big utility
change or anything. It's just a a bike
race, a cyclacross race. Um, I don't
know, Graham, if you know if how long
it's going to be. I think it ends this
week. Uh, but
>> I I believe it was it's today and
Saturday possibly.
>> Okay.
>> Um, that's not us running that. That's
just in the park.
>> Yeah. Just continually get these phone
calls. What are y'all doing? What's
going on? So,
>> all right. Good deal. Thank you.
>> Karen, do you want to just have your
report in the presentations?
>> Uh, okay. So, presentation, we have
Karen Sites, who's our park ranger and
volunteer programs coordinator
coordinator uh going to go have give a
presentation for us.
>> All right. So, while the slideshow's
pulling up, I just want to talk about
National Public Lands Day real quick.
Thank you for coming out. I appreciate
it. Um, we had a great group of
volunteers who completed the list that I
had for them. Um, and painted the
benches, the bleachers around the
baseball field. Uh, the baseball fence
was full of overgrowth. They got all of
that out there so near guys can come
through and fix those holes in the
fence. Um, of course, always picking up
litter and there were tons of limbs down
still for the storm and then just when
it does flood, there's always limbs
anyway. They got all those picked up and
pulled to the curb and then our guys
come through and get all that picked up
after them and we had a great lunch uh
to Ziki's after and they were so happy.
Um they appreciated something beyond hot
dogs and um when director Adcock showed
up she said this is the best the park
has looked in years. So it was a time
>> it was a very well done event. So kudos
to you and your team for putting that
together.
>> Thank you. Thank you. All right, let's
talk Junior Rangers.
So, the Junior Park Ranger Camp is a
groundbreaking, awardwinning day camp
for 9 to 12 year olds.
Um, where we educate, energize, and
engage them about the natural
environment via our park system. We do
not leave our park system because we
don't have to. We have 63 pieces of
property to play on. So
when I say it's award-winning in 2015,
it was created and we won the ARPA
natural resources program of the year.
When I say it's groundbreaking, it's
because at the time when I was doing my
research, I never found another program
like this at the time. There's junior
ranger programs like with state parks,
federal parks, but they're self-led.
This is a week-long. They we pile in my
van and we drive around to different
parks.
So, this program
operates under the children's outdoor
bill of rights. This was adopted by
parks administration
and um has 10 activities that children
have the right to do in the city of
Little Rock Parks and Recreation uh park
system. Play in a safe place, explore
nature, learn to swim, go fishing,
follow a trail, ride a bike, play a
sport, connect with the past, plant a
seed, and play with your dog in a park.
So to achieve this, we have several
goals and I'm just going to mention a
few. Teach respect for parks and nature,
promote community and volunteerism,
encourage children to experience nature,
and give them the opportunity to develop
a sense of wonder and joy for the
natural world.
Day one. All right. Day one, they get a
backpack full of gear such as water
bottle,
um, binoculars,
first aid kit, compass, books about
birds, ducks, snakes. Um, and then the
adventure guide. And this is our
curriculum that I created. Um, FYI, my
undergraduate is environmental, soil,
water, and science from the UOVA.
So the first thing we talk about is
safety. You're welcome, Perry. Next,
we talk about things like poison ivy.
Let it uh leaves of three, let it be so
that we can identify it, right? We talk
about how to remove ticks safely. We
discuss uh what to do if we come across
a snake.
We talk about how to deal with uh
chugger bites. We talk about rules of
the park such as all pets must be
leashed. We talk about manners in a
museum and how to stay in a group.
Junior park rangers do not go solo. We
also talk about the food chain and how
it is affected
when invasive species come in or pushy
plants come in. Um we talk about native
flora and fauna. What is flora and
fauna? What does that mean? Uh we talk
about the water cycle, waterheds,
wetlands. Uh we discuss our drainage
system underground and how it's an open
system and not only does water go in
there, but also litter.
And then of course we have a lot of
history in our parks. So we discuss that
and we have our junior park ranger
pledge.
So what we do first is we go to uh
Western Hills, Benny Craig and
Centennial Park. So at Western Hills we
go birding. We hike around the park. We
see all kinds of fun stuff. Find some
treasure like the snake skin you see in
the picture. Um of course we see all the
bugs. Um, lots of little frogs, water
lilies. Um, then we also have lunch
there. Um, we go through most of the
curriculum on the first day and then it
bleeds a little bit into the second day.
And as we're out in these parks, we're
applying what we've learned. We're
seeing what we've learned. Then we head
to Benny Craig. And of course, Benny
Craig is on Fush Creek. So, we talk
about the watershed and Fush Creek. We
have a little trail there we go down.
And when it's wet there, when it has
flooded, it's very slippery. And we get
dirty in camp. We get dirty. And my van
smells like we get dirty.
Then we head to Centennial. And
Centennial, um, there's, you know, some
good history there. It used to be a
school and the bell tower is still
there. At every park, we pick up litter
and at every park we play. So we learn,
we play.
Day two, we head to the Bill Clark
wetlands. Um,
and we talk about what a wetland is, the
benefits of a wetland, walk the
boardwalk, see the turtles. If we're
lucky, we might see a gar or something.
Then we head down to the um riverfront
where we learn French. La petis ro and
what that means, where that came from.
We see the sculptures. We eat in the
river market. We have ice cream. Thank
you, Mr. Leland. And then we u hit the
much anticipated splash pad. We all get
in the splash pad cuz it is hot. We
sweat.
We sweat. We We sweat so hard. It's so
hard sweating.
Um day three. This is the only time we
spend inside.
This is where we go to MacArthur Museum
and we go to the Firehouse Museum. Um,
and a big kudos to uh staff and
volunteers at both of those facilities.
They really give phenomenal age
appropriate, engaging uh uh programs for
our kids. Have a great time at both of
these. And then we roam the park. Uh we
make it over to the playground which
they love. Of course it's it's still
newish and so a lot of them are hitting
this park at the fir for the very first
time. Um and then we go via the pond and
the whole time we're picking up litter
and um usually find dead fish and things
that end up in the trash bag which is
the smelliest day of the whole uh day of
camp.
Day four, we hit the archery range and
the pool. And uh thanks to Mike's staff
there. We thank them for hosting us. And
of course that is definitely anticipated
as well and it's a lot of fun.
And the last day, Friday, we have
fishing, a pizza party, and graduation.
Some catch fish, some don't. A big shout
out to my uh volunteer park ranger John
Wheeler who helps me put together the
poles and helps teach them. We teach
them a cast. We teach them to put the
worm on the hook, but we only do that
one time after that. It's up to them. Um
and we just fish all morning, have a
pizza party,
and then we have a graduation ceremony
where family and friends are invited. So
throughout the whole week we are
processing and we um I'm asking them
questions you know how many parks do we
have? What is the watershed? Uh what is
this? What is that? Etc. And by the end
of the week they've all got it down. We
have an oral quiz and then we graduate.
They get a certificate, a badge,
a t-shirt, and that backpack full of
gear they get to take home except for
the binoculars.
And then we are done with the day. We
are done with the week. Um,
all of this is for the low price of $50
a week per child. And
I do this three weeks out of the year.
So the first two are what you see. Next
I'm going to do it differently. The
first two is what exact exactly what I
describe. The next one I'm going to
re-engage those who have graduated. Once
you graduate, you can't go through it
again, right? So, but you can be
re-engaged. So, I'm going to have those
kids who have graduated come back
through and we're just going to go to
different parks, right? Um, still talk
about the curriculum, maybe take a
little bit next level. Um, but then
we're going to start that next year. Um,
I appreciate all of our sponsors. Ozark
Outdoor Supply gives this backpack at
cost. Uh, Jennis Archery donated the
bows. Um, I also appreciate the
recreation staff that I mentioned as
well as our operations divisions who
helps get the parks ready mow the
archery range um the bullse eyes
replaced cuz they usually need it by
then. And um in closing, I just want to
say that I love watching these kids
learn and grow and develop or continue
to develop a love of nature and a love
for our park system. It is truly truly a
breath of fresh air for me every summer
to get to hang out with these kids.
These are my babies and I love every
single one of them. Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> Any questions?
Is it sold out typically?
>> Um, so we do it three weeks. It usually
does fill up. Um, this last summer it
did fill up and then I got really sick
like at the end of the first day. So
unfortunately I had to cancel that week.
But it has it has filled up this last
summer. And we also so we started this
10 years ago. I worked here for a month.
graduated with my masters and put this
together in 30 days and we implemented
it. Um,
and it's always filled up. Then co hit
it like it did everything else. So last
year was the first year we brought it
back. So it's not a new program, but in
many ways it is because the public just
doesn't really know that it exists.
Do you advertise it at the same time or
in conjunction with the summer youth
programs at the rec centers or is it an
option or let people know or is it
>> what we did originally was we pulled
kids from the community centers and it
was free for them. Um then over time I
did kind of both community centers and
in public and then the last two years
we've just done the public but we do
promote it like in our social media
channels. Um if there's some event I'm
at beforehand I do that as well.
>> I'll ask one softball question.
>> Okay. Um, what is your operating budget
as a as a volunteer um, coordinator for
not only the city of Little Rock, but
for the parks department? And what
aspect of that do you utilize for this
program? And how would you grow this
program if you had potentially more
funding?
>> I thought you said softball.
I would say this t this program takes a
little around uh five thou 5 5,000 to
operate per year. Um we have to keep it
at 3 weeks because it's a state law. If
you don't have a facility to house it
out of, then any program has to be 3
weeks or less um to grow it. That would
need a either I would need uh help with
in another van
um or a actual facility to house it out
of and grow that. Uh but then you're
also getting into heat related issues
cuz when it reaches a certain
temperature, we have to come in. So, at
this point, it's about 5,000 for that.
Uh, for for me, actually to run a solid
volunteer division, if we're going to
start getting into banquetss and things
like that, um, a parks and banquet would
approximately be around $5 to $7,000.
And then I would say anywhere from
another 10 to 15 would uh be the
operating budget for the division.
>> But, and the number one question was
>> what is your current budget? Oh, zero.
>> All right. Thank you. Z.
>> No problem.
>> Thank you.
>> Just a quick change of plans. I I've got
to leave in in about 10 minutes, but
we're going to motion to go straight to
new business. We can come back to
unfinished business um to to vote uh for
the strategic plan. So, can we get a
motion to move forward to to right now
to new business?
I'll motion
second.
All in favor? I.
Okay. Um, moving to new business. Uh, we
talked about this last week, but uh,
Leland wants us to vote on the strategic
plan. Um today we do have quorum so I
wanted to go ahead and and lean if you
have anything you want to say before we
vote but uh I don't have any updates uh
we shared it believe you all have a copy
if you don't mahogany can provide it
again um but if there's any questions on
it I'd be happy to we just didn't vote
on it previously we've discussed it
several times so
>> okay go ahead make a motion to vote on
the strategic plan.
>> You would.
>> Okay. I'll make a motion to vote on the
strategic plan.
>> Let's I'm going to clean that up a
little to approve or disprove. Like if
you Let's make it very clear if you want
to approve it or not.
>> So just a motion to approve it or
>> I'll motion to approve the strategic
plan.
>> Second.
>> Okay. All those in favor of approving
the strategic plan say I.
>> I.
>> All opposed.
>> Motion passes.
>> And um just uh our third and final parts
commission visit is at 400 p.m. tomorrow
at Boil Park. The previous two have been
uh I think the first one was at
MacArthur, the second one was at West
Central, and then this one be at
Pavilion tomorrow. I plan to be there at
4 um and looking forward hope hope the
other commissioners can join us um at
400 p.m. tomorrow. Uh, I don't know if
Director Lewis um knows about it, but I
know this is in her award, so um hope
hope she can make it as well and anyone
else uh on the city board and and the
staff. So,
any questions or comments about the
parts commission
site visit tomorrow?
Be a whole lot cooler than West Central.
So, hope we be able to see the to the
park. Um, I've actually never been to
Boral Park, so I'm excited to go check
it out. So,
okay. U, so let's go back to unfinished.
I'm a
I'm leaving in about five minutes and,
uh, Quinn's going to take over for me,
but, um, the subcommittee report um,
master plan, do you have anything um,
Canon on that?
>> No, we didn't we did not meet today, so
I don't have any updates.
uh parts conservancy is um you know same
usually leads out he's out today so I'm
going have to kind of get an update next
month and then marketing
>> nothing on the marketing
>> okay
as as in every uh unfinished business
please continue to consider uh posting
some photos of you of yourselves at uh
uh send that to Graham if you do get
that um
presentation list discussion selection
for net's meeting. I think this is going
to be ongoing. If you have any um ideas
for nets meeting uh that's going to be
ongoing on and unfinished business
um
parts feature directory update I think
Gabby are you planning on presenting
that next month? Is that right?
So, we met with some higher up people
about changing the website and we are
unable to make any big changes until
they move the website to the new
platform.
>> Okay.
>> So,
>> is there a timeline for that?
>> Probably by the end of the year that's
when they'll move it to the new website
and then we can make the updates after
that.
>> Okay.
>> I'd like to add to that is that they are
currently working still on the back end
of the website. So, um, depending on
what our ongoing understanding of the
website update is, we could definitely
still
stay tuned. I mean, maybe we can present
some some information so that it's not
one big jump all at one time at, you
know, January or something like that.
So,
>> okay.
Um, budget discussion. I know Leland
talked about it in his report. You know,
I think nothing's been scheduled for
2026 on the operating budget, but do you
have any I don't know if you had
anything else to add.
>> Do not.
>> Um, new commissioner subcommittee
assignments. You know, with um Quinton
being vice chair, I think we're looking
I guess one to replace him and also we
have two I guess our two newest
commissioners um Chris and Mabel aren't
here today. I don't I guess I assume we
have to probably table this to next
month because they're not here. Um
so we'll just table that to next month
if if everyone's okay with that.
>> All right. I'm going say silence is is
yes.
>> Yes. Yes. Yes.
>> Um
I guess I mean have has anyone talked to
you know Chris was here last month. Um I
know we had three new ones. Chris and
then Mabel and then a gentleman that was
going to become this. He just couldn't
make the Wednesday meetings anymore, so
he declined. Has anyone talked to Mabel
about
Mahogany? Have you talked to Mabel about
I don't think she's been the past couple
times.
>> No, she hasn't. And we've attempted to
make contact. Um
but so we're just sticking with the
process.
>> Okay. of uh you know if she doesn't
attend uh 20 over misses 20 more than
25% of the meetings that she'll do
>> um
>> okay
>> so
>> should if she's
I mean should we should we wait till
maybe November and then I think put it
to a vote to remove her if
>> or I mean are you
>> sorry I believe the process is automatic
so we don't need to vote to remove her
or anything like that. Uh if she's
missed the required number of meetings,
then we can just go ahead and submit our
request for commissioners to the city
clerk.
>> Okay.
>> Do you know cuz I I looked online
on the commission website. Do you know
when they're going to start posting the
openings for parts? I didn't see it uh
on the vacancies for the commissioners
for the commission since we I guess we
maybe have two now.
>> Yes. And um
>> I know it's a process. I'm just
>> and the director may want to speak to
this. Um we're not we're not posted in
the same area.
>> Okay.
>> Um and so as far as advertising, um I
mean it's out there, but it's just
posted in a different area from my
understanding.
>> Okay.
All right. Um
Okay. Well, thank you.
So, we'll table the new commissioner
assignments till next month and then I
guess um we'll let Mabel know about
about that or I guess termination. Um
um
Simone, you brought this up last month
about a commissioner retreat uh maybe
before the end of the year. I think you
talked about maybe looking for places to
do it. Um you said it probably be couple
hours.
um during during the week. Um have you
had any further updates on that?
>> Unfortunately, there have life is
lifing. Um and so we're right now we're
I'm working with staff to plan something
for early next year that way and it's
this is a very busy time for everyone.
That was the other part of things is
just October, November, December is
holiday season, festivals. Everybody has
places to be. So I figured January,
February probably be best.
>> Okay.
Okay, I'm going to uh turn it over to
Quinton um to do the last couple of
agenda items. Um I have to head out, but
I will see everyone at 4 pm tomorrow at
Boral Park. Hope you can make it. Thank
y'all.
Well, I don't see any other items on the
uh agenda here.
>> So, I guess um
there's board leaison feedback. Um does
anybody have anything on that?
>> Yes.
>> Yes, Kathy. Thank you.
>> Thank you, director.
>> Everybody just thinks I'm sorry. Just
one thing. Um there is a bullet point
for agenda items for next meeting.
>> Oh, okay. Yeah. And so
I turned myself off. I just wanted to
give uh make sure that we cover that in
case there's something else that uh any
other members want to add.
>> Okay. Um Director Peek, do you mind if I
hit that first and then come to you?
Okay. Does anybody have any agenda items
um they want to bring up next week?
>> Next month.
>> Next month or next week, I guess,
whatever you want to do. But uh Okay.
Hearing none, we'll go to the board
liaison.
>> Okay. I I will be brief and we might get
out of here early. Uh, first of all, the
reason I had a small joyous moment and
hit Leland on the back and then
disappeared for a minute. Uh, that was
Commissioner Ellis, uh, one of our
colleagues, and he, um, uh, if you know,
um, operates the Rocktown Outfitters,
and he had applied for a Native beer
license, which was denied by the ABC. He
appealed it, and he won. He did.
>> So, I think that's great. Um, I was a
big supporter of that. Uh, and he had a
lot of good letters and they listened.
They wanted him to put up a barrier,
which he can do. And this is an amenity
you'll find all over the country at
river trails, um, and in parks. So, it's
not like a big beer garden. He'll, but
you can buy native beer after you get
off the river from kaying or canoeing or
jogging or cycling. So, kudos to Sam. Uh
the other thing that is parks related, I
mean everything because we live in a
city with 63 63 parks could be parks
related, but I'm just making a pitch for
adopt a street, adopt a park, adopt a
flowerbred, adopt a trail. Um I recorded
a podcast this morning with Rex Nelson
about the update in our pick it up
litter campaign uh that I led and began
last year. And we now have um 42 new
people that have adopted something. So
we now have 172 adopters. We're making
headway especially downtown. They went
with the uh most adopted streets during
the last year. Uh and then the Heights,
Hillrest, Capitol View, Riverdale area.
Uh they were second. Uh we really need
some adoptions out in uh Ward Six, the
John Barrow area, and in Southwest. And
we I know we have parks and trails and
flower beds that could be adopted. So my
my ask is that everybody sitting at this
table, if you haven't adopted a park or
a street or a flower, I'm not looking at
you like I'm but but to do it. It's
easy. It's fun. Uh you only have to do
it four times a year. Uh this all lives
on the public works website of the city
and the sustainability office. Super
easy to navigate. And once you
successfully do a cleanup, just twice a
year, you get one of those cool signs
with your name or your business, your
organization on there, and it every
little bit helps. So, I'm asking for you
all to adopt a street or a park or a
trail or a flower bed.
I'll be checking back on that next next
month. Just kidding.
>> Does anybody have any questions for
Director Peek?
>> I have a question. Um, so on the website
it it'll tell you what is available to
be adopted and Okay.
>> Well, actually, no. Uh, but you will
Well, you can let me know what you want
to adopt and I can We don't have that
yet. That would be so exhaustive to lift
everything because there's more not
adopted than adopted and and you you'll
see a sign. Is is it in your
neighborhood or around your business? I
I was just thinking our salon could do
that.
>> That would be great. Right there on
Kavanaaugh
>> and and then that promotes the the um
keeps Kavanaaugh clean. It promotes the
business. Oh, I wish you all would do
it. Okay.
>> See, that's why Kathy has so many
because y'all y'all live in the in
Hillrest and work in Hillrest where
people are doing the right thing a lot
of the time. Oh, I hope you do that
summer. That would be great.
>> Any other questions?
Hearing none. Um, I have one unrelated
to
Miss Peek. Um,
thank you Shawanda for adding I know in
the recreation report I'd asked for more
like
memberships or attendance or things like
that and it's all in there. I really
appreciate it. Um,
I don't know if it's been highlighted,
but I mean, just so everyone's aware,
Jim Dailyaly is up like
from 1500 to 2100 memberships versus
last year. So, I mean, I guess people
came back with the pool being open. Is
that's what's driving that or is it
something unrelated?
>> What's driving it, Leland?
>> Are you Are you asking?
>> Yeah, I'm asking. I'm assuming it's the
pool. That's, you know, but yeah, I
would say that at Schwanda, do you have
it in in particular? I I know that we
have strengthened our leadership there.
Um, another place where we got a lot
more certifications there. We got AFO
certifications that helps with our
understanding of pool maintenance
greatly. Um, our operations staff have
cleaned up a lot of things in terms of
the roof. And we had a old um, you know,
outdoor pool area, the splash pad area
that we couldn't find the funding for
for a long time. So, we went on and
filled that in with concrete and and
covered up so it's not an eyesore. Um,
several other things, but uh, Shondaanda
could talk to about the programming
probably a lot better than I can. that
we've increased our programming, her
classes and activities and things going
on, more family oriented events and
things at Gym Daily.
>> Okay. Um, no, I appreciate it. I just
like Anyway, I'm a numbers person, but I
like seeing it so that we can highlight
it for people when they say, you know,
>> why aren't you guys doing this or why
aren't you guys doing that? It's like,
well, you know, some of the stuff's up
almost 50%, you know, from last year.
And I know you guys got a lot of knocks
for the pool uh 12 15 months ago. That
was pretty rough.
>> It was
>> seemed like it was coming up about every
month, you know.
>> I appreciate that. And we actually have
another huge uh improvement there. The
uh pool roof over the indoor pool or the
the whole roof, not just the the roof,
but the ceiling. Uh when we were we knew
that there were some challenges with it
from an operation standpoint. uh in the
process of um renovating the indoor
pool, we actually had it in our bid to
um replace the ceiling or aspects of it
and improve it. Um that ended up being
worse and and we found a lot worse, you
know, uh issues there. Um so we've
actually bid it. We have a project.
Justin's managing the project to um in
terms of a time frame, but we're
actually have the funding and and
everything in place to uh replace I I
don't know about 3/4 of that roof, I
think, and ceiling completely, which is
a massive project.
>> Yeah.
>> Um I'm very concerned about the fact
that we might have to shut down the
indoor pool again. And um but we've uh
Justin's going to work with our vendor
to make sure we limit that um very much.
But and now I'm concerned that it might
be snowing when we take it off. So we
might I actually said that in staff. Uh
Schwanda said, "Well, maybe we could
actually have like a swim in the dark,
you know, see see the stars and and
>> swim,
>> you know, kind of kind of play into it."
You know
the the only other thing with the
numbers is if um Rebsman and first te uh
if we could see something on that
because I know that I echo what was said
earlier about I've heard from my father
and other people who play there that the
course is much improved from a year or
two ago and so it'd be nice even if the
numbers don't reflect it just to sort of
see the numbers there. Yeah, I I
actually don't know the exact number,
but I know the numbers. In fact, I had
to uh report some of that in our budget
hearing. Um my in our revenue office
here side because golf is is a big
revenue producer here, roughly about a
million and a half dollars in revenue.
Um our numbers were slightly off from
previous years. We really hit it out of
the park in previous years. And as was
coming off of CO, you know, golf was one
of the highlights during CO, right? Um,
so we we've continued to keep that that
momentum. Um, but, um, what we've
changed a little bit is that we got a
lot of complaints that we were just
pushing people through the course so
much. Um, and so our staff and
leadership there has asked if we could
just tone it back a little bit, put a
little bit more time in between each
round or each, you know, team that's
going out. And so I think that might be
reflective a little bit. And um, but
it's hard to tell exactly where we don't
have a software that actually keeps
track of every user and all this in
terms of like a more of a data-driven
software system that that I'm actually
looking at for our department. And
that's just one area that we would use
it in. But um you know the other big
factors are weather related. I don't
think we've had any crazy weather this
year greatly. But you always start to
forget about it until it becomes you
know like where where was that heat?
Where was that heat index? When did it
did we have a heavy spring rain? I don't
really remember recall exactly all that.
We do report on all that
>> and we have those numbers but
>> um but anyway I we're we're definitely
have no concern. We're doing well. But
I'll I'll share those numbers next
month.
>> And then the last one is to put it in
your ear and Mrs. PC's ear as well. Uh
Revsman Tennis Center. I talked to Chip
um because it said we lost the Southern
16s, which is a bummer. Uh that's a big
regional tournament for USA Southern. Um
it's 128 kids that are 15 and 16 for
guys and then 128 that are girls. The
girls have been trailing off. this last
year was only like 56 or eight. Um where
the guys was still basically sold out
like 128. Um swapped it for a new
tournament. Chip is he's done a great
job at Revsman with filling tournaments,
getting tournaments in there. Um he's
actually on the Southern USA competition
committee now. So not that they owe him,
but hoping that we can sort of get some
reciprocity for losing it. Um, and it
looks like we're getting a tournament
that has like at least 250 competitors.
Um, which at least 50% will be from out
of state. So my question to him was
outside of the pro tournament, does
visitor and convention or any of those
kind of things ever help at Rebmen? cuz
he is he being the head there. And
Shawan, you guys drive drive a ton of
out of town guests into town through
those tournaments at Repzammen. And I've
looked at it some, but um I think that
would be a good number to get in front
of the board and also the conventure
convention and visitors board to see if
they can help with some of the
maintenance or just some of the other
things or you know, I don't know. Just
putting it out there. But there's a lot
of people that come into town cuz that
tennis center. I mean, a lot.
>> So, you said a lot there about resin
tennis and I'll try to cover as much and
quickly as possible. But, and I'm don't
know how many of them were actually
questions. And it sounds like you know
more about resin than you know maybe
some of us here do. But, um, you're
correct in terms of all the stuff that
you said about Chip and his leadership
in terms of getting tournaments. And
yes, we lost that one tournament. That's
really concerned. I I understood it from
him that it was more about um the
fall-off of some of the users and and
and that um the other thing that he
always tells me, I think he starts every
conversation with me about boy, if we
just had an indoor tennis facility like
everybody else, we would be smoking it
in every every area. Um and so, um I'm
working on that from a federal grant
standpoint. uh we're not going to get um
if we get it, we won't have a full it be
a safe room that we'll convert into an
indoor tennis facility, which will be
partly what we need. Um but that was
part of our sales tax initiative as
well. Um and so um yes, he does a great
job in keeping our numbers, but um
there's a little bit of concerning there
about that loss. Uh Little Rock CVB does
support the Little Rock Open. they give
us quite a bit of money for that. Um we
split that. The city of Little Rock
actually we have another uh a little bit
of pot of money for that. So the board
actually um agrees to that every year
and so we want to make sure that um you
know Cappy and others are listening in
terms of supporting that funding. Um,
but you're right also in the fact that
the Little Rock Open is our only uh from
a park standpoint and quality of life,
our only city tournament that is
actually bringing economic impact into
the city of Little Rock. Um, you know,
other cities are doing multiple
different things. We've really tried to
figure that out in terms of other sport
complexes and we haven't been su
successful in that. Um, so I appreciate
you bringing that those comments. I
don't know if you had any other
questions in there or if that was more
just you wanted to get that out there,
but
>> yeah, it's just to get it out there, get
it I mean more percolating that with the
Revsman and first TE golf just sort of
plays and that kind of thing. I know
uh given the economic environment
uncertainty that you know budgets are
probably going to be tighter this year
and it's just I'd like to
uh push for the continue to push for the
things that are growing and not sort of
strangle them while they're growing. So,
>> well, your comments are greatly
appreciated here and um I am um working
with Little Rock CVB. I actually have a
upcoming meeting with their one of their
sales teams um members. Um she's new.
So, um we're we're going to have a new
understanding of what maybe there's some
other potential there. You know, I don't
know if there's something for golf or
something else. Um and so um Shanda and
I will be discussing that with her in
terms of our different facilities. But
um anyway, thanks for bringing that up.
>> Sure.
>> Anybody else have any other questions?
>> Hearing none. Do I have a motion to
adjourn?
>> It's one o'clock.
>> Oh, sorry.
>> Okay. Since it's one o'clock, we don't
have to do that. All right. Well, thank
you all for coming and we'll see
everybody on tomorrow at 4 and then
November 12th um right back here.
Thanks.
