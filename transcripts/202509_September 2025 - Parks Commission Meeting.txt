Um, we're one short of a quorum
or short of quorum.
>> Oh, no. I'm sorry. I got to stand
corrected. We have a quorum.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. Um,
can we get a motion to approve the
August meeting minutes?
motion.
>> Second.
>> All in favor of approving say I.
>> I.
>> I. All oppose.
Okay.
Um, do we have any citizen
communication? I don't see any citizens
out there.
Okay.
I'm going to um pass it over to Leland
to
uh go over his reports and and if there
are any questions on staff reports as
well. So,
good afternoon. I'll just start. Do any
of the uh commissioners have any
questions on the staff reports?
>> Seeing none, hearing none. Moving on. Um
any uh questions on the board agenda
items? The latest item that we've
discussed uh that was part of the agenda
was the um it was really under fleet
services, but it was for Resmond and
First Tolf, which are two new spray rigs
for um for us to be able to maintain the
two golf courses and that was at the
agenda meeting Tuesday night. And um the
previous meeting to that, we had nothing
on the agenda, nothing at the director's
meeting that I recall. And um those are
the board items. So then staff reports
and then so I'll move to um
the events and um Karen, would you like
to give us some updates? We have several
events just as she's walking up. We have
several events for uh September. There's
quite a few things going on. So um I
think Karen will cover hers.
>> Sure.
>> Good morning.
>> Morning. Just want to remind you quickly
that we are having National Public Lands
Day on September 27th from 9:00 a.m. to
11:30 with lunch afterwards on Leland.
Thank you. And uh we will be of course
always picking up litter, but also
picking up there's a lot of down limbs.
Um one of the main goals is to get a lot
of those picked up around the fence
line, that baseball field, so that then
our guys can come in behind and fix the
broken fence. We'll also be painting
benches um and doing just an overall big
cleanup of that park, weed eating around
the disc golf course, etc. Uh the mayor
is opening is up and Vice Mayor Wyrick
will be there as well. And thank you Ben

many years we've been doing this
partnering with parks, but it's been a
it's been a number of years. So, it's

Okay. So, moving on. Um, Graham, if you
want to cover I'm trying to make sure I
I have a list of events and I'm trying
to make sure we get them all covered.
So, if anybody knows anything that

please speak up before the end of this
section
>> before we move off the Oh, okay. This is
Graham. So, this
>> Yeah, we're still under events. Um,
>> yeah. So, there's a lot of events coming
up. I'm going to cover um a few of them.
some of the highlights. So, the battle
under 6:30 we mentioned last month,
that's the 3v3 basketball tournament at
Kanes. That has been postponed to
November 1st. Um, and we'll be
transforming the event a little bit. It
won't just be the basketball tournament.
Um, we're going to try and utilize the
whole park and have things in all the
different areas there. Um, like
skateboarding and we'll still have the
basketball tournament and some other
things as well. Um, so we're final
finalizing details for what all that's
going to be, but um, it has been moved
to November 1st and that date is set.
And then we have Logan's run on
September 20th coming up that is put on
by our therapeutic recreck um, division
as well as Little Rock Marathon. And
that is for um, that's a race for those
with disabilities. and it's also the the
kickoff to the All Abilities uh
marathon.
So, uh that's at Murray Park on
September 20th. And then we have the
Arkansas Salsa Festival at West Central
Community Center on October 11th at 12
p.m. So, uh, if you if you have a great
salsa recipe, you can come out and you
can enter or you can just come try
different salsas and should be a lot of
fun. Um, for Halloween and fall in
general, we have a lot of events at the
community centers. There's fall festival
at Southwest on October 25th. Um, and
then we have trunk or treats at Stevens,
Dunar, and West Central. Um, at Stevens
and Dunar it will be October 30th from
6:00 to 8. And at West Central, October
31st from 6:30 to 8:30.
Those are just a few of the highlights.
We have a lot more going on. Um,
especially just recreation programs. So,
any questions?
and thanks for the emails you've been
sending. That those are really good. So,
>> yes. And I'll send an email once we get
um the battle under 6:30 and all that
finalized.
>> Cool.
>> Okay. Before we move on, I'd like to add
several events to the list too or just a
few updates in terms of uh from my
director's report. But um
let's see just real quickly here on the
13th will be a disc golf course uh popup
event at War Memorial. Just some just
some just quick highlights. There's also
a Murray Park uh 5K run down in Murray
on September 13th. So, I'm sure there'll
be a lot of activities going on in
Murray Park on the 13th. There's also a
group of us, our um deputy directors and
a couple managers um and I will be going
to Orlando for the NRPA conference um
next week. So, we'll be out um going to
learn more and um go to an great exhibit
hall and learn more there from um our
colle colleagues in the um profession.
Um let's see. There's several other
things I do want to mention if you
missed it, but uh there'll be upcoming
ones. There's a mobile city hall. We had
that Monday night. Um and so our staff
participates in that by putting up um a
uh popup at that event as well in terms
of what we offer to the uh area. And so
um I don't know when the next one I know
the next one will be roughly in a month.
I don't know the exact location, but um
just want everybody to to be aware of
those and come and participate. Um
there's also a um
um a large public um input opportunity
for a project that we've been working on
for almost a year now, which is a 30
crossing project, which is the um new
park location in downtown Little Rock.
Um it's between Clinton Avenue and
Second under the 30 crossing. It's the
area that was developed by the removal
of the old offramps of 30 crossing. It's
roughly 15 acres of of parkland and
we've uh finished a uh conceptual master
plan which we'll be presenting to the
public on the 20th and 21st. And so I
asked for everybody to come down and
share their input. And so on the 20th
we'll actually be on Clinton Boulevard
at the Uler building or space uh there
across from the river market hall. Uh
you can come down. I believe the hours
are from 4 to 6. um Graham or G um
Mahogany if you want to make sure we
share the uh flyer again to the
commissioners. There is a commissioner
that was unaware of this uh this event.
But on the 20th there's that event and
then on the 21st there's the food truck
festival and we'll have a um 30 by30
tent set up and that's for all the
public to come and participate in this
uh great project. So um those are just a
few more highlights. So, if anybody has
any follow-up questions to any of those
events,
>> Kathy,
>> but and there's one more, the big damn
bridge ride. I just came up the river
road and all the signage is up to beware
for be aware of hundreds of bikes on the
27th of September. This is a great event
for the city. I don't know how many
people have It's grow. It grows every
year, but the river is going to be
happening.
>> Yeah. And actually um there's another
event I thought about when you said that
there's Tinkerfest which which parks has
nothing to do with
>> discovery
>> but it's in um for the Museum of
Discovery and it's in the 30 crossing
space.
>> Oh, cool.
>> So it will be with the where the food
truck will be the next the following
week um on that Sunday. So a lot of
great activities going on in in Little
Rock and um I think that covers
everything for park events.
the flyer for the 30 crossing. Um,
public input. Um, I have that mahogany.
I'll send it.
>> Okay. Any questions for Leland before we
move on to presentations.
I think we have a Justin last uh month,
you know, talked about section 13. Um,
will he continue to talk about in the
presentations per the agenda? I I'll
cover that real quick. Um
>> Justin is set up to give presentations
when we have something big to present.
Um but we currently are working with the
city attorney's office and that's still
in progress. Um they have been working
on it. We're in the process now of uh
title search for the property as well as
updating the appraisal. Um and those are
all to be uh completed hopefully before
next month and we can share more
information then.
Um, right now we're just working through
all the due diligence and um, that's
that's the biggest update for today.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. We're moving on to unfinished
business. Um, subcommittee reports. Um,
master plan. Uh, Mike, do you have
anything?
No,
we're mostly just um discussing various
master plans that are in place or
different ideas that are being
developed, but mostly uh we're waiting
on the section 13 feedback to come back
from the city. When that happens, then
like we just discussed, we'll okay
>> have it presented back to the
commission.
>> Okay.
>> Okay. Um Parks Conservancy. No updates
at this point.
>> Okay. And then marketing. Um I know
we're going to talk about this in new
business as far as the assignment since
um Quinton is now the vice chair. We
need someone to um replace him, but
we'll talk about that in new business.
Um
can guys just remember uh if you
remember to
submit a photo of yourselves if you're
at a park, just send it to Graham. Um,
parks commission vacancy appointments. I
think do we how many vacancies do we
have now? Simone mahogen. Do we have
just one?
I know one gentleman couldn't be a he
one gentleman that was appointed
can't make it on Wednesday. So, he he
dropped out. So, I know we have at least
one. I know for sure
>> that and also JT's vacancy. Okay.
>> Um, and possibly
um another one pending.
>> Okay. So, three vacancies right now. two
and a possible.
>> Okay.
Well, if you guys know anyone that
you're interested in the parts, please
have them check the check online at the
um city of Little Rock website.
Um presentation list, discussions,
session for nets meeting. I'm I don't
think we have anything with that. Um
>> can I speak to that?
>> Yeah. Um, you know, I've I've said this
in many many meetings. Um, I always
think there's a great opportunity here
for us to share do a quick presentation
on anything. There's so many things that
we're doing and the public is not aware
of and I don't know if the commission is
aware of everything what we're always
doing. So, um, I have a list that we
covered in new agenda in the, uh, master
plan committee of projects. Um, I know
Karen Sych has a program, the junior
ranger program. she wants to present on.
And so, um, I'll just, you know, ask
again or my request would be as the
commission would, um, entertain putting
something in there for our presentation
to continue, um, our opportunity to
share what we're doing.
>> And this will be in the presentations
agenda,
>> right, for next month or
>> Yeah.
>> depending on when we want to do it.
Okay.
>> Yeah. Sometimes obviously we've um had
certain things like section 13 other
things come up and are conflictual with
that. But if we can have a little bit of
an understanding from the commission
that there might be a desire to have
some other ones or we or we could just
off I mean we could just continue to add
some things that we think are the most
up and coming. Um
however I mean it's just something that
I think is is worthy to do if we don't
have any other pres presentations.
I I would love to learn about the junior
park rangers. So I I would Can we motion
to put that for presentation for next
month or we can we talk about session 13
next month in October?
>> Can we just have a placeholder for parks
and recck uh presentation and then let
them decide what they want to do with
that each month? Would that be better
lend or not?
>> Yeah, then that's that's excellent.
Okay. And so if section 13 is is ready
to go, we'll definitely make that for
for an example for next month.
>> And then if it's not ready, then we'll
cue uh Karen for that. And then
>> for the next, we'll we'll continue to
add until somebody has um a particular
request.
>> Okay,
>> sounds great. Thank you.
>> Okay, Mike, do you have anything in the
park features directory update? It's
unfinished and it's unfinished business.
So, it's really uh deliverable for
Graham.
>> Okay.
>> You want Is there any update on that or
or Gabriel? Either one.
>> Yeah, I've been working on that um the
last couple weeks and I'm having to like
rewrite all the pages and then make
updates as like one big chunk. So, I'm
hoping to have all that done in the next
couple months.
>> Awesome. Thank you.
>> Thanks, Gabra. It's great to hear.
>> I'd like to add to that. So, Gabby,
could you could we put you on the spot
and say, you know, November or something
like that, you could give a presentation
to this commission?
>> Yep.
>> Like actually show the website on I
think you can lower the screen. Is that
correct, Mahogany?
>> So, you could lower the screen and then
you could,
>> you know, show us the website, kind of
walk us through some of it. And I think
that would help. Mike, um, he's still
asking me if there if we have the master
plans on the website, stuff like that.
So,
>> so you're talking about a general
website overview as opposed to just the
features directory.
>> Yeah, because I know Gabby is updating
it and you and there's a lot of
commissioners would stay and citizens
would say that it's challenging to get
through. I mean, even Gabby will sh I
mean say that it's it's a really
difficult website in terms of all the
directories and all the information on
it.
>> So, um and maybe it's a just a halfway
part point in November, right? I mean,
I'm sure it's always going to be
something to be updated, right?
>> Right. Yeah, I can do that.
>> Yeah. Okay, that'd be great. Thank you.
>> Just for clarification, I was whining
about trying to find a document on the
city site, but anyhow.
>> All right. Uh, website assets review. I
don't know if if any of the Fletcher is
not here, but I don't know if any of the
parts
uh employees have any update on this.
That's what we just talked about in
reviewing the website.
>> Okay. All right. Well, that's okay.
We can just probably make that one
bullet for next time. Um
Sam, do you want to I know you requested
about the Arkansas River Trail update.
Can you talk further about this?
>> I can. Um it was uh worked on with
Graham and I. I sent him some of the
information that we've collected and we
share with all of Little Rock's tourism
and guest that rent bikes and use the
river trail. Uh he has taken and updated
to the Little Rock City website and uh
it is um now updated and you can
actually see where you are while you're
using the trail on your phone and um I
know that'll it'll grow and make changes
as the trail grows, but it looks a lot
better and I think that was done done
well. Can we show that in November as
well in the presentation? Just knock
everything out. It's like y'all have
done a lot so far. So,
>> yes.
>> Thank you all.
>> I don't know if anyone has anything to
add on section 13 for the next two
bullets. Um, were the public hearing
dates did they go? Were they that didn't
happen? Okay. So,
>> but that but just to be clear, they
didn't happen because we still don't
have a completed
>> legal opinion from the city attorney and
they're not going to be able to complete
their legal opinion until we finish the
other things stated and
>> y
>> so it's it's as expected from our
Justin's original presentation. This is
a process and and it's made to be a
process like that and that's why we have
I mean if we could if we could liquefy
properties overnight, you know, that
would be scary. So, uh, you know, this
this is a good thing that it takes this
process. So,
>> so on the agenda, can we just replace
the dates that are in parentheses with
TBD?
>> Well, since it's an in unfinished
business and we're at the point of we're
not at the we're not there yet. Um,
it'll fall off the agenda until it's
time to be added back on.
>> That's fine.
>> Okay. um the net's bullet. Um
Mike Ingram, who leads Redmond Golf and
I had a discussion and we're going to do
this focus on doing this tournament um
probably in May again of 2025. I I would
kind of like to
>> 26
>> 26. Yeah. Um I would like to maybe put
this in new business maybe in like
November, December so we can actually
talk about dates. I think we're kind of
early right now, but could we just um
maybe in maybe in November maybe put
this in new business so we can actually
talk about dates in May um that works
for everybody and I can get with Mike on
specific dates that can work for
Resmond.
>> Yes.
>> Would that be okay?
>> Okay. Thank you.
>> Okay. Um moving on to to new business.
Um I think we've already talked about
and have a solution that uh Graham has
already discussed that a website assets
review which we'll have a presentation
about in November. Um
the next bullet if you uh you should
have got an email from Mahogany about
that has the strategic plan um for uh
going through 2030. Um Leland, I don't
know if you had any want to make any
comments or if anyone had any comments
from uh from the email that we've
received, but um
>> yes.
>> Okay.
>> Uh the strategic plan um was completed
end of last year. It was presented to
this commission um throughout the
beginning of 2025.
And um we look back and surprisingly uh
historically we found that we never
actually officially finalized a vote on
it and approval by this commission which
would be a request from myself. And so,
um, knowing that there's a new
commissioner, we've shared, um, a
printed version of the of the plan with
that new commissioner, and for everybody
just to refresh and make sure we're
we're good and and we would like I would
like to add it to the agenda for next
month to finalize the uh, vote. And we
would like to make sure that, you know,
the commission can um, support us in
this this goal and vision process. I
mean, this is a a plan for the next five
years, and we're we're already looking
at aspects of it and moving forward with
it, but um we would really like your
support and and approval for it. So, if
there's any questions on it, um in the
meantime, I'd be happy to to share that
or even the at the beginning of the next
meeting, but I would like to call for a
vote to to officially have the
commission approve it. So, that's what
that that's why we added it to new
business.
>> Can we vote on it today? would need to
be voted on next month.
>> If the commission so wanted to vote it
on today, that would be great, but I
just didn't want anybody not to have the
opportunity. I mean, if anybody had any
questions and needed more feedback or
time. So,
>> I would like to do it in October. I
haven't had a chance to really dive into
it. So, um
>> Okay.
>> Well, will the city of Little Rock board
directors have to vote on it too or or
not?
>> It doesn't in the in the previous plans,
I don't believe so. Um no.
>> Okay. And so, um, but we do want it as
part of our accreditation process. We
want it to show that it's been, um, it's
not only is it the commission is
approving it, but it's also being
presented to the public. And so, um, we
will share this as well as once it's
voted on uh, to the public. So,
>> Okay.
>> All right. We'll we'll add we'll make
that as a new business for vote for next
next month.
>> Perfect.
All right. Um I know it was brought to
attention last month about the budget
for next year and I think um Director
Couch wanted to kind of talk about the
budget.
>> Yes. Just just referring back to um
previous years from the commission.
There's always been a request for the
commission to be involved and advise on
um requests for the budget. And so we
have as a city started um the process
for the budget. I have not officially
presented anything to the city board.
So, there is not any the process hasn't
started with the board. Um, we plan to
do that very soon, but um I I struggled
here and I I wasn't going to say this,
but there's so much in terms of a budget
to to be discussed that I'm just going
to keep it very high level and um let
let commissioners ask questions or and
then also, you know, please feel free to
give your input. I mean, that's what
really I see this discussion as more
about is the commissioners sharing input
so that I can factor that into my budget
request to the board and the mayor and
the city manager. Um, so typically just
I'll just start off unless there's any
general questions before I start.
Seeing none. Um so the um the process is
is generally looking at the budget is um
let's just say um parks has our general
budget which is the parks department.
There's also and and that's all
encompassing of all of our community
centers and and tennis and everything
except for golf and um gym daily
fitness. And the river market actually
falls under the parks umbrella, but it's
a completely um separate leased facility
that is through Little Rock CVB. So,
it's not really anything that um the
parks department currently manages or
operates. And so, I look at it as I have
three major items. the parks which is
collective of everything outside of gym
daily and and golf and so and then in
the big scheme of things parks is
approximately $12 million a year. Uh
golf is 1.8 and gym daily is roughly
around $800,000.
Those have all pretty much stayed in
kind of in a relatively the same budget
area for for many years. There was a
budget cut uh several years back and
that cut um big chunks of different
things out, but nothing has changed in
my time as director. Um it's just
fluctuate a little bit because of
staffing raises that the board and the
city manager and the mayor um put into
effect
and little changes that I can put in as
requests. Um so that's that's kind of
the process. Um the other thing that we
also review heavily is our staffing. So,
um, complete full-time staff for the
parks department is 130 staff. Um, we
have, I believe right now 108 in, um,
parks.
Let me see if I can do the math right.
108 and then there's 15 in golf and then
the remaining eight, I believe, is in
gym daily. Um, we always have roughly
across the board about 20 vacancies. I
think the last time I ran a report, we
had 19 vacancies and it just completely
changes all the time because of
retirement, people leaving, uh, new
hires, all kinds of stuff. Uh, we would
love to fill all the positions. There's
no reason that we wouldn't try to fill
all the positions. Um, but it's
constantly changing and, um, the budget
request period is actually the
opportunity for me to ask for more
staff. um is it I'll just be very
transparent here or you know for us to
just you know add more staff or add
millions of dollars to the budget is not
likely. Um but it is an opportunity to
make those requests and and see where we
can do things. We can also talk about
moving staff around. Um and we and we
can do that kind of whenever depending
on uh different areas um and what our
limitations or constraints would be. Uh
any questions on any of that? I do. Um,
as far as the, you know, the $12 million
budget, is that inclusive of any grants
or donations from nonprofits?
>> Yeah, great question. Um, no, that is
strictly our uh sales tax revenue that
comes in as our our revenue for our
operations. So, we um do many many
different grants and that could be a
whole another presentation, right? But
millions of dollars realistically. We
have a metrop plan grant that was over
$3 million for a trail project. We have
RTP recreational trail project grants.
We have a storm shelter grant for um
different uh two different locations. Um
so we're
>> So those are directly project related.
>> Yeah. So the ch right those the
challenge for the grants are that we
would receive let's just pick one which
was the trie greenway which was $3
million 3 million plus in in an award
right well we have to come up typical
grants would require a 20% match
>> and so roughly on that was a $750,000
match so that becomes the the challenge
when we don't have capital dollars
anymore because the last sales tax that
was active here was in 2021.
>> Okay. So, we're limited on the A lot of
people nowadays will say, "Well, you
should just apply for more grants. Get
some more volunteers and some more
grants and you should be good to go,
right?" Well, so a grant and I smile
because I'm just, you know, it's a grant
cost on the match side of things as well
as I mean Justin could smile to this is
how much engineering and time have we
put into
>> uh to get that project off the ground.
So, I would say we probably spent about
$1.2 million to acquire that $3 million.
So, the grant is still great. We get
that, but at some point we're going to
run out of match and it gets more
challenging. So,
>> so I guess my followup is, you know, so
that kind of covers the project side of
the side of things, you know, as far as
any other um I mean, I know there's 501
at least one 501c3 out there that
supports the parks directly. Um,
are there I I guess you know what I'm
asking is is can you kind of speak to
just kind of like the ambient kind of
donations y um you know that are that
aren't necessarily project related is
just to kind of support the health and
maintenance of the parks.
>> Yeah. So we uh you were referencing we
do have a city and park conservancy
which is our nonprofit foundation. um
they're active, however, they have not
generated, you know, hundreds of
thousands of dollars every year or
whatever. They manage a lot of different
dollars that come in for projects. For
example, we did a fundraiser and thank
you to to Trios. We did a fundraiser
there and we raised roughly $75,000
and portions of that ran through that
nonprofit. Uh in general, I would say
that we are not as successful as we
should be in terms of raising private
dollars. there's just nobody on our
staff that has that expertise that is
going out every day and knocking doors
and raising money. Uh individuals help
us like Kappy's been great in helping us
raise money in different aspects. Um and
we appreciate that. And so, um, we get a
lot of one-offs in and smaller projects
like people want to donate money for,
um, the dog park or for a bench or a
sculpture.
>> And y'all done a fantastic job with that
around town with all the sculptures and
park and that whole nine yards.
>> Yeah.
>> That that's Dean Compurus and his group.
>> Yep. So, in sculpture related, we've
been donated over eight million or let's
say we have $8 million worth of value of
sculptures and um so I don't I don't
know the exact amount that was donated,
but that's what they're valued at now.
And that that's across the city. Um a
lot of people would say, well, you have
a heavy set like in Riverfront Park.
Yes, we do. But we also have them across
the city and several other uh park
locations as well as rideaways and
roundabouts and different places
throughout. So, um, lots of different
ways and, um, we've always tried to
partner with others. A lot of, from my
experience, a lot of it is, you know,
for somebody to want to, um, give money
to a major project, they really like to
see that the city supports that project.
>> And so, for example, let's say we're
going to go do a major project in War
Memorial. It's helpful for us to have an
initial backing of a project there. and
then we can say, "Hey, we're doing this
and we really want your support or your
name on this."
>> Um, and we've been successful in some of
that, but um, others we haven't. I mean,
we and we've had some donations from
AARP was a local one where we had a fit
lot down on the river trail and that was
100% donation. Um, different grants for
different playgrounds. I mean, we could
go on and on, but
>> in terms of just straight, you know,
sponsorships or donations, we're we're
still have a we could go a lot farther
with that. So, okay.
Thank you.
>> Yep.
Um
>> Leland, I have a qu. Weren't um were you
challenged this year to have a redux in
your expense at parks? And the follow-up
question is is that going to be
reflected is that expected to carry on
to future budgets.
>> So in terms of future budget, your
ending question there, um that's
completely up to the mayor and the city
board and city manager. Um, in terms of
the first question, yes, we were we were
asked I was asked just to study some
different options. Um, and it's just
because the uh looking forward to the
future, they wanted us to be able to do
our homework and see what some options
of um reducing our budget could be. Um,
but there's uh nothing is is set. It was
just a, you know, we're always, I guess
you could always say I'm always looking
at I need more money for this and this
and this and so it's always looking at
doing that was a good homework project
to see if there was something that we
could um reduce or sharpen our pencil
on. So,
>> thank you.
>> Yeah. So, um I got my whole book here. I
could go down to individual accounts to
show to tell you where all the money
goes or any questions like that, but um
in general that's a that's a big um
overview of the budget just in in terms
of that. I will be presenting to the the
board and that will be public and when I
present to the board there'll be more
information and then my understanding
and Cappy you could correct me but it'll
go through hopefully not the entire rest
of the year but there'll be some
discussion from the board in the next
different meetings after um we give our
reports and and then there'll be a
finalized budget. Is that correct?
>> Yeah. Yes. And I I'll make a couple of
comments. It because parks parks is
overwhelming going through that budget
workshop. No, nobody no department does
what parks does. I mean there's so many
different things and all these things
that we have to maintain. Uh so the the
um game plan is we'll have a dayong
workshop Friday from 8 until 6 and then
we have a followup in if we in case we
need it um on October 3rd. So, this will
be a major topic of the of discussion at
the next board meetings until we can can
pass it. Um, but it is it's really
impressive to go through the book and to
see how much these 130 employees are
responsible for. Other departments have
more employees, but nobody has as much
stuff to to maintain and manage, I don't
think, as as Park. So, I'm I'm very
grateful for that. So,
>> Well, thank you.
>> I'll be fighting for you.
>> Yeah. Kathy, can I So maintenance aside,
when the city does the budget, do they
build in capital dollars right from the
beginning or is that always project by
project?
>> Pro? No, from the beginning, but then
they're inevitably projects that come
up. And you know, the the problem
in my time on the board, and I know it
has been going on for probably two
decades, one of the first apartments to
get cut when it's time to make cuts,
it's parks,
and that's just the way it is. I I I
don't like that. It's it's the big
quality of life issue. But I know um I
just can't commend staff enough to do
because they are always asked to do more
with less and they have so much to
maintain. So we just need money. I would
personally like to pass the sales tax
and it just go to parks, public works,
and public safety. We could pass that. I
know I'm saying it on record. That's
okay.
Everybody loves parks. When when when
you start involving lots of other
things, it's just it's too much. But the
three Ps, people will always back the
three Ps.
>> All right.
>> I have one more thing to add. So there's
like Cappy's correct. There's so many
different things that uh Little Rock
Parks has their hands in. And one other
one that a big one that I left off and I
feel bad for is at the Little Rock
Marathon. So, Little Rock Marathon is
housing Little Rock Parks as well. And
in terms of private dollars, um Chris,
you you were asking about that. They
raise all their own money. Um they
obviously charge people to be in the
marathon. That's their revenue source.
But the Little Rock Marathon staff,
which is very limited, um is is all um
ran by the revenue from the marathon and
sponsorships and fundraising. Mhm.
>> Um, so kudos to Geneva Lamb that is our
executive director. She's been doing it
for over 20 years and um, you know,
everybody needs to sign up for the next
race. So, and she puts on many other
races and events for us as well. So, um,
but that's just another leg of our our
department. And and I and I know I think
this was mentioned the last meeting, but
uh the marathon is so generous, they
actually gave $50,000 to parks
conservancy to specifically go to
reservoir. So it's
>> right. So and they've given actually I
think over the years um I guess they
were probably quickly approaching like
$2.5 million in in funds to the parks
department. So that is another source
there uh funding
>> and just so so parks conservancy they
don't have like an endowment fund or
something that they've been working on.
They originally they started um I don't
know 15 or 20 years ago and um the parks
director worked with um a group and they
they created that uh conservancy and my
understanding is is that they originally
had a lot more money and they were a lot
more able to to generate revenue and I
don't know if that was just a different
people of the board or how they managed
it or how they were active. um they
still have um a small nest egg and
they've given um small amounts to
different projects and different uh
deals, but um realistically
um we need like a champion that is
actually out there focused on, you know,
hey, we have this great project and we
need to raise a half million dollars for
um this $5 million project, right? Um so
there's always that opportunity.
Thank you.
>> Okay. Um,
section 13 is an S. I think we already
talked about that. Um, new commissioner
subcommittee assignments. Um, I know
with uh Quint Quinton was the chair of
the marketing committee and since he's
vice chair, I think we're looking for a
new committee.
If I'm not mistaken, I think the current
people on each um subcommittee is I know
it's Mike and Canon on master plan. Uh
me and Sam and Sam is chair of the
conservancy.
What do you which one you on?
>> Conservancy. Okay.
>> I'm I'm on the master plan committee as
well. Oh,
>> okay.
And then marketing is Shamia and
Quinton. So, I think um
do we need a master subcommittee chair
and then a new marketing subcommittee
chair? Is that what we're looking
forward to do? Okay. Um
I'm going to just throw it out there. I
think conservancy Sam's chair as long
then me and Summer are on it. So, master
plan has Mike, Canon, and Sam. Since Sam
is already chair conservy, Mike, are you
and would you be interested in doing it?
>> Um, I think Canon might want to do it,
so we probably should at least ask him.
>> Okay. Well, we'll we'll push the master
subcommittee to new business next week.
Um, and Shami is Well, I guess we just
have to push it because Shami is not
here. And I don't know, Chris, if you
have any desire to be on on marketing, I
think that's that one only has two
people. Um, you'll work a lot with Gabby
and Graham. But I think I guess since
Shamia and Canon aren't here, probably
need to talk more about that next month.
>> But Chris, you have any interest in one
of the three subcommittees?
>> Uh, yeah, I do. Um I I think though that
uh I want to meet with you and Leland
offline before I make any commitments.
>> Okay.
>> Can I can I suggest something just for
discussion is
>> maybe it would be helpful if you move
the golf tournament um under the
marketing social media subcommittee just
to have it housed in a committee
somewhere. Um, and it's, you know,
honestly, it's a a golf tournament would
be marketing us as well as you got to do
a lot of social media to get the Yeah.
>> all the stuff. And
>> so that's just an idea.
>> Yeah, that's a good idea. Or it could be
conservancy because the golf committee
the funds go to conservancy, I believe.
So,
>> um,
>> also just a reminder when you have your
subcommittee meetings, please be sure
you're recording and that you are
letting the public know at least three
days in advance.
>> Thank you.
Um,
we'll I guess we'll table that to next
month again to to maybe talk more about
new chairs for marketing and master plan
and
>> adding golf.
>> Can you give a little um just overview
high level overview of each committee
and what they do? I think that's missing
with asking the new commissioner.
>> Yeah, sure.
>> Getting into
>> Yeah. Yeah, I mean uh marketing you work
a lot with Gabby and Graham about on
marketing social media strategy. I don't
I don't know. I'm not in it. So, uh I
don't know if anyone I don't Gabby or
Graham if y'all want to talk about the
subcommittee because um
>> beyond saying some buzz words about
marketing. That's all I got.
>> Share some requests or helpful feedback
that you would get from advisory
committee. Yeah, our our goal for it
would be just to get feedback on like we
would present um maybe our our social
media post for the next month and get
feedback since you all are our target
market basically. So we would just want
to get feedback on all the posts and any
ideas on how we can um promote different
events or programs we have coming up and
yeah anything from emails to the website
to the social media just getting
>> newsletter
>> new perspectives on it.
>> Okay. Um Mike can you talk about master
plan?
>> Yeah. So for the master plan, obviously
we're looking at the master plan that we
have for um the the various parks and
any of the sub plans which use quite a
few of
>> they get generated for things such as
the I30
um crossing in and downtown and etc. and
then try to figure out from those what
we want to feed into the commission. So
for instance with the asset disposal
there's a process. So we review that
first, make our recommendation to the
commission, get the right information
presented to the commission so that this
commission can then vote to send that
forward to the uh to the boards of city
directors.
>> Sam, conservancy.
>> So conservancy is uh how we essentially
bring the money in and how we are able
to use it for parks. So it's uh
attending there's the actual meeting
that Kappy and Leland attend and I try
and attend those to
bring back the notes from those meetings
and what the plan is and how we're using
that money.
>> Okay. Anything to add to that, Kappy?
>> I don't think so.
>> Thank you.
>> All right.
Uh, looks like we have a a agenda item
from Simone about the commissioner
retreat.
>> Yes, thank you. I just wanted to um let
you guys know that if you wanted to have
a commissioner's retreat where you sit
down and talk about the plans and goals
that you have for 2026. You can talk
about Robert's rules and how you guys
want to follow, if you don't want to
follow, if you have questions about
Voya. This is still an open meeting to
the public. Um there are no decisions
being made, but it's just an opportunity
for you guys to have more time to get
together to really discuss what you
value and what you'd like to bring up in
future meetings. And then you would just
uh if that's something you're interested
in, you would uh need to get with U.
Park staff. Mahogany is happy to work
with you guys on how all of that would
look and all of that, but we just wanted
to let you know that you did have that
opportunity and option if you would
like.
>> Okay. Have you seen other
volunteer commission members do this?
Yes. Does this happen a lot? Okay.
>> Um, City Beautiful Commission does a
annual retreat um where they just sit
together. They've talked about the
history um and kind of just discuss some
opportunities that they might want to
pursue. It just gives everybody an
opportunity to kind of think about
what's on your mind as we're doing this
um without having to make a decision
because there's no decisions made and
then you bring it up here and you guys
can fully develop the conversations you
want to have and go back to parks and
ask them to do things. So, it's really
just you guys sitting together chatting
about parks.
>> That'd be an opportunity for us. Last
year we struggled with the uh we did get
it accomplished but the yearly report
and so maybe if you had it a little bit
later in the year you could use that
opportunity to you know actually come up
with parts of that yearly report
>> is it usually I know it depends on on us
but on a weekday or weekend how does it
>> I've only done one before so I will tell
you it was during the week um I think it
was at like 3 or 4 o'clock in the
afternoon we met for an hour or two just
we had a facilitator to kind of guide us
through some discussion and what matters
to you, where's the history, where do
you see yourselves going and like you
know just kind of kind of
>> thinking about what helping you think
about what you care about so the next
time we meet we can have those
opportunities kind of fresh in your mind
to talk about.
>> Okay.
Yeah. I know we've had these quarterly
well three site visits planned. We have
one planned for October 9th on at Fort
Payment at Boil Park. Um I think it'd be
cool to maybe have a
if we do decide to have a retreat, maybe
have it at a park um again that we not
really familiar with. But um yeah, I'm
all for trying to do that later this
year.
>> You want to have it in a park at the uh
towards the end of the year outside?
>> No, I meant like a like a community
center. I mean, I'll sorry. I'll clarify
that somewhere inside.
>> We have a picnic in the snow.
>> You, you know, you're from Arkansas. It
can be 75 degrees in December.
>> There's there's several different
facilities even outside of the community
centers that I would recommend. I mean,
there's
we could come up with some creative
spaces.
>> Okay.
and uh for the October 9th. So Chris,
just to let you know, we we're this year
we've kind of had some site visits
actually go and visit some parts. So in
April we went to AMFA and MacArthur
Park. This past July we went to West
Central and then October 9th at 4 p.m.
we'll do Boil Park and we really just
get a tour of the park and um get to
know more about the park. And so I'll I
us I'll email I'll get Taten
and staff about the logistics of it, but
I will uh make sure I'll email everybody
before the 9th. We are meeting October
8th for our next meeting. So the next
day would be our our visit. So um
any agenda items for Net's meeting?
I think depending on how section 13
goes, that could be discussed. If not,
we'll have um
um we'll have Karen do an overview of
the junior park rangers. Anything else
for next for October?
I I just have a quick question as
actually for you Simone. So, are you
involved as um in the city attorney's
office with the section 13 piece at all?
>> I am. I am. I'm working with Sean uh to
get the title work and then also making
sure that the board is following the
ordinance for asset disposal.
>> I mean, I know it's a long process. So,
so if I want to bug somebody or Leland
does it would bug you and Sean, not Tom.
>> It depends on what you want to discuss.
Um, but I'm happy to be available to
direct you in the right.
>> Well, thank thank you. It's it's that's
a huge opportunity, a big deal, but I
know there are a lot of eyes to dot and
tees to cross. Yeah.
>> Yes, ma'am.
>> Okay. Um, back to you, Kathy. Do you
have any four leazison on feedback?
>> Um, and this is we're we're going to be
in the middle middle of the budget stuff
starting Friday. So, not really, but uh
a couple of people have mentioned um a
little post that they saw next door
about reservoir. So, I talked to Leland
before I did this uh because people are
always asking what's happening. I drive
through there, things look good. Are the
trails open? Blah blah blah. So, I
listed nine things that we are currently
doing or on the horizon that will be
done very soon. Like the playground and
I got a lot lots of feedback and Leland,
this is really it'll just take one
second, but in all the comments, are you
listening to me Leland over there?
Sorry, I was asking. We had a question
when I
>> Sorry. Go ahead.
>> Summer
>> sit between those boys and separate. So
here here are the comments. First of
all, people are so excited, but they
would like more basketball, but we
already have basketball. I didn't even
know it. Expand area with semi fullcourt
basketball to two full courts. I'm just
telling people's pipe dreams. Can we
destroy the invasive nandas since they
kill birds? probably all the dandas are,
you know, the little red buried things.
I didn't know they were toxic to birds.
That's one request. So, get on the
nandas, Karen. Invasives. Get on it.
>> Um,
>> can there be a walking path from
reservoir into the park for people that
live in Sturbridge and other areas to
access? And I know that's actually kind
of been a topic of discussion before. I
thought maybe you and I talked about it.
>> A walking trail off reservoir, not a
park. I'll wait I'll wait for all your
comments and then I'll
>> Okay, I only have two more.
>> Say no.
>> Dog park, dog park and disc golf, which
we're working on because that will come
back. And if y'all haven't driven around
reservoir, it used to be scary. It used
to just make me want to just cry. But
things are cleaned up. The pavilion is
fixed. The tennis courts are ready. The
playground equipment has been ordered.
We were getting ready to plant trees. We
planted some. It's not scary anymore. It
is kind of 64 acres of
not a lot, but it looks a lot better.
And I think we're on the cusp to really
start seeing some things happen there.
So, I just thought I'd give you those
suggestions, not from me, from from the
the community.
>> So, thank you for sharing that. And
>> how do you like I shared it publicly,
not just sent you a text? Um
at some point um Justin could give a
presentation on our updates to the
master plan. So just for everybody to
understand, we did go through a master
plan process. Cromwell um helped us with
that master plan initially that we
shared with the public. They did that
work for us for free. And so it
addresses a lot of um the uh items that
you have brought to our attention and
one of them for example is like the
trail or the access from Reservoir Row.
Um I've stated publicly from day one
that there's no desire to put a um a
vehicle access from Reservoir Row for
the public, but a trail access as long
as we can find a safe crossing and work
with public works and all that good
stuff uh is. But this is the opportunity
for me to share is that as much as we
went and did the took the opportunity to
do a master plan for Reservoir Park
because of the the challenge of the
destruction of it in 23. Um it has it
needs to be set, you know, clear that we
only have or received funding because we
did so much work on the front end with
FEMA and insurance and structural
engineers and all these great people. um
only that money can only be used to put
back essentially what was there. So if
what was there was a 1950 or 60 ball
field that was in poor condition because
of flooding and the way that it was
originally constructed back then, we
have very limited amount of monies to
build back. So Justin is working through
a master plan process to make sure we
have all the bells and whistles and all
the things that we want such as a dog
park. there wasn't a dog park, but we're
designing a a dog park to be part of
this project. But realistically, we're
having to find, you know, make sure that
we're not we're designing something that
we can take the monies that we received
from FEMA and insurance to build what we
want to build. So, we've added a little
bit right to the playground um so that
we wanted to have a bigger playground
and also because the cost of things have
gone up. But um and we've redesigned the
ball field, but the ball field is going
to be where it where it is, but we've
fixed the flooding and all those issues.
So, I mean, every little aspect of this
is a challenge. The the restrooms the
same way. Instead of just building back
what was there and saying we completed
it, we've actually built a whole
designed a whole new restroom and um we
bid it and we were waiting to issue a
notice proceed. So, a lot of steps. Um
if anybody's listening and want to hear
more detail, Justin or myself can be
available and um I appreciate your
feedback.
>> Yeah, I I know those things. I just want
people to tune to tune in. Uh but I will
say one more thing um on the amount of
private money and conservancy money and
thanks again to the marathon for
$50,000. Uh there's a little um match
with the Stevens um uh group who had a
longtime employee who was actually a
friend of mine pass away. She's a master
gu she was a master gardener lived in
Leewood loved reservoir. So we have a
fund for her and right now after Stevens
makes their matches it'll be close to
$20,000.
>> And we can we we can do anything with
that. But uh well not anything uh but
and I'm continuing to kind of keep that
door open uh for for Mary do something
nice for her.
>> That's great. Thank you very much.
>> Okay. If nothing else, um next meeting
is October 8th, 2025 and here at 11:45.
Appreciate everyone's attendance and
everyone listening online. We'll see you
next month. Benot
make a motion to close the menu to end
the meeting.
>> I'll second the motion.
>> All in favor?
>> I
>> I
second your own emotion. I'm second the
motion.
