wood things and he cried for like five
minutes and he got back up and tried
again um if I were going to pitch
anything I'm not just here always to

in Walton Heights but we've been
geocaching I ran into Quinton actually

it enough but Bole Park is legit thank
you I have one comment yeah go ahead
yeah hey Ryan I just want to share with
you about geocaching a previous uh Parks
employee that was here for over 40 years
Jim sick was our maintenance manager he
was really big into geocaching and I
believe he still has probably tons of
them or I know he does throughout the
parks um and so offline we should
connect and I'll give you his

good I'll put forth my whole program and
PowerPoint at some point but we that's
it for now thank you'all right

operations HR Finance payroll as for as
as well as
um public and Recreation safety and
Recreation report as well so um any any
questions um for any of the department
heads that are here I don't think Justin
is here but uh any other questions for
Shanda Angela or Courtney or if you have
any general questions about maintenance
operations can I'm sure someone can
answer it besides Justin so
hey Andrew I just had a question on is
you have about 21 vacancies across the
park is that a lot is that about
average right now that seems to be like
a steady number okay um I believe at one
point we may have had maybe
30 at some point so we are are making
some progress um you know Britney of
course is has left us and we have a
youth uh program coordinator that is now
open so we're just trying to you know
stay stay above and just try to make
sure we get some people in those
positions and we do have some positions
that are
advertising so to me it is making
progress okay thank you it's great
hey Shanda in in your report about um I
was just curious on the gym daily
Fitness memberships you said in December
you guys sold 1729 is that total
memberships or is that did you guys
actually
sell 1700
memberships that was just for the month
of December is that the total membership
you have no that's just for the month of
December oh wow so what's usually the
total memberships at a given point in a
what's the average I guess throughout
the
year um you don't have to be just a
guesstimate I'm just curious because um
selling 1700 me that seems like a lot to
me selling 1700 memberships yeah it it
fluctuates around um a thousand a month
okay each month times 12 so yeah okay
any anyone have any other comments
questions for any of the reports
um Shan has a question yeah Shan do you

uh all of our uh adults and kids with
disabilities thank
you there no other staff report
questions I'm going to turn it over to
to Leland to talk about his his
report okay good afternoon um
because of what we have on the agenda
and we discussed um end of last year I'm
here to present on the uh budget for the
Department I'll give a um kind of a
snippet out of um the budget document
that the board approved so the the whole
document is roughly 100 pages and I
think I have about 15 pages to go over
so if mahogany if you could start with
the budget
this document is actually the document
that um I have access to that was
actually uh the one that was right
before it was finally approved at the
end of the year um but it will give you
a point of uh view for uh or reference
for what the um the numbers are for the
department and uh please stop me at any
time if you have any questions so next
question I mean next slide
we'll kind of go through these fast
mahogany
so next slide
so these are just
some policy statements from the board of
directors you can see their must do and
then where we fall in line under we have
a lot in there from safe City Economic
Development all these don't get me wrong
but we're also in the bottom um Quality
of Life under should do statements next
slide these are the core values from the
mayor's office um I can go through those
but that's a whole another presentation
but just to show you um those are the
values that the city of lck has today
next
slide these are some of the bigger
factors that are played into the budget
preparation um obviously sales tax uh
Union negotiations there's a bunch of
different things these are just a list
of items to show you um that you know
what is some of the involvement and
again like I said I only took 15 pages
out of the whole budget document so this
is a really Brief Review if we wanted to
get into bigger understanding of the
budget I definitely would want a the CFO
to come and give a presentation so next
slide can I ask you a quick y question
absolutely uh any of the employees under
you in the Parks and Rec part of the
union or is that yes our construction
staff or Union
okay um those the here's uh next slide
mahogany just a few other things the
biggest thing that is a factor um and
vice mayor uh BJ can probably give some
other explanations as this as well but
is our sales tax revenue so right now
it's relatively flat or almost going
down um and so it's just all about um
that and our Revenue um that is coming
in so next
slide and these are some of the um from
so we presented the directors presented
to the board some of their feedbacks
affordable housing
homelessness um you can see us we're in
there at parks and wck services and
facility maintenance um and then dish
clearing and maintenance that's for
public works next
slide uh again this is their what the
board uh wanted to uh align their uh
policy statement towards and um we're
down under uh quality of life there at
the bottom you can see zoo and golf
funding next
slide next slide so I want to just it
might be hard to see these numbers but
in generally the uh parks department
generates Revenue so um parks and wreck
is one line in there and it it generates
roughly 300,000 to half a million on a
given year um our big uh Revenue
producer is our Golf Course uh golf
courses produces over 1.3 million in
Revenue um River Market is also Under
the Umbrella parks and rck they have
some revenue and then um our Jim daily
facility also has a sub substantial
revenue of about 4 to 500,000 depending
on on the year um as well so those go
into the general fund just to give you a
sense and then there's obviously tons of
other revenue forecast and again this is
just one slide but just wanted to cover
a little bit of what the revenue is from
from our standpoint next slide
I wanted to get into just a little bit
of our staffing so you can see here
parks golf and fitness we have a total
of 130 uh full-time positions so we
already stated been asked the question
do we always have 20 vacancies we
roughly do have that and that's just
turnover retirement um people leaving
and and time for us to rehire those
positions ultimately it would be a goal
to have a much lower um loss of of or
vacancy
um but it is a constant challenge for us
to to fill and keep those positions uh
filled at all the time so but that gives
you an idea of the city as a whole as
well um next
slide so I through this slide in here
this is the one slide that really talks
about the funding that we got previous
years of uh we did uh get 400,000 in in
maintenance um which was additional
funds uh for this year year we received
$60,000 for concessions at the pro shop
at our golf courses I made a big pitch
for that as well as our senior facility
um and so right now we have this uh um
new funding for our concession which is
great it'll generate new revenue and
help us at our can our offset some of
our budget loss at our Uh current golf
course at Rond next
slide uh this is showing our whole
budget for the uh all the way back to 23
so there's an actual budget then there's
an amended budget I mean that so what
you're seeing is there's an actual
budget so there's a b proposed budget
for 25 right and then at the end of the
year they'll they'll final it out and
what what is the difference it's all
about Personnel cost um it's also um for
this year there was a is a 1.5 or 1.75
uh raise for non-uniform staff and so
there's obvious viously a new cost there
so that factors in but you can see what
I would like to share here just a
takeaway is just the bigger numbers par
wreck is is 10 uh over $10 million in
budget and then there's River Market
Golf and fitness and those are all
combined to be roughly 12 to13 million
next
slide some of the future steps um and
this is just looking ahead in 25 what
some of the recommend ation or is review
our existing City facilities and
property determine our needs um this
could result I mean this was a
conversation that came up about sale of
property or buildings um looking at all
of our assets all of our facility
maintenance um private and uh Public
Partnerships uh I think there's a lot of
room for us in both of those categories
in terms of how we maintain our existing
facilities and um Partnerships that we
need to grow um and so
when it says here the uh CFO will bring
back some recommendations is my
understanding in q1 of
25 um and there's also been a
compensation study uh that has not been
finalized but so there's a obviously
there's a little bit more in here from
not just from Parks and wreck I've tried
to just copy out what was for for the
parks uh next
slide I think that might be it yep
questions so any general questions I
know that's a quick overview but um
again that's just giving a general
overview of the budget for
2025 on the compensation study is that
just for parks and recer is that for
everybody at the city yeah that's great
question so no that's for everybody um
so it's been an ongoing review it's been
a very very long time since the city has
uh completed a compensation study so
they we worked through it all last year
um but ultimately my understanding is is
it takes capital or new new dollars to
really Implement a lot of that um but
that would be an HR and you know um
larger discussion from others outside of
myself to discuss the next steps of
that and then on the on the golf you
mentioned that it it had
Revenue um but I'm assuming that it's a
net net loss I mean right so
it it brings in 1.3 right but when we
I'm
I didn't mean upt but when we talk about
golf we're talking about revman and
firsty yes okay it's a combination um
but in terms of our expenses or our our
budget that we have for that it's
slightly under that but the uh
challenges is that we're not um
replacing our Fleet and I mean we I
could spend millions of dollars at golf
currently on replacing Fleet and
improvements to the course and so those
are the things that are not factored
into that budget um we use special
project
allocations um for different
improvements and uh Bond money for
example to buy a new Fleet so it is
essentially like a break
even um item but we need additional
funds for the other
improvements you know I'm going to ask a
question
um
regarding this was the operating budget
how does the
capital or improvements or over and
above arpa other things how does that
factor into this or not or how does that
presented yeah so it's not uh capital I
mean it's not uh included in this the uh
budget the operating budget right it's
um so it would be all additional funds
Capital dollars so it's um the bond
money money that we had and the co
relief or arpa funds those are just all
separate funds that um arpa is all ended
at end of 24 um we did uh save the money
for this facility which is still that
biggest outstanding cost for that and
we're finalizing West Central well not
finalizing it it's under construction
now which is one of our other big arpa
projects but all the other community
centers are all wrapping up in terms of
those funds um and then there are
ongoing bond funds which um we've
reported out on previously and could do
another report but they're they're
different from this uh budget I guess
you could
say Miss wrick H how do you all as a
board look at that then I mean if you're
doing an
operating how often do you all refresh
both together or they always separate or
how does that work just for someone who
doesn't attend the meetings yeah no what
he's what he's uh what Leland is really
addressing is um
our operating funds for the city and um
as you can see it was balanced balance
between what we think our expenditures
are and and what our um Revenue uh we
expect to bring in um from sales tax um
utility uh money that comes in I'm
trying to think what else we get as uh
the finance or the umer franchise Fe
property tax yeah franchise fees I
couldn't think of franchise fees when I
said utility so that's that's basically
what it costs to keep the city the city
going and you ask about um Union
employees and a big part of our cost
goes to police and fire and um
then their their contracts were up this
year and um
the police got a 5% increase
contractually that's what was negotiated
and that's what they got and then the
fire department uh
also um is going to get a 5% now there's
a some sort of disagreement uh on the
contract it's not really been finalized
but um that was the offer was 5% so uh
when you look at those numbers it takes
a lot out of our operation budget um but
I think we all agree that we need police
and fire I mean if you watch the TVs and
you see what's going on in in California
with the wildfires uh you know you
understand how important our fire
department is and and both of those
groups need Capital dollars for
equipment fire trucks cars and that kind
of thing in regards to the um parks
department we had pretty good discussion
about golf
and a hole that needs to be replaced
along the Arkansas River and I think we
did fund that didn't we Leland right so
that kind of Go full circle back to your
original question so we funded that and
I stated that in the was is out of bond
money um so actually out of the mod
money I took $1.5 million out of bond
and allocated to to golf for Fleet the
whole that um we're referring to funding
the Pro Shop in regard regards to being
able to have items that uh we can sell
right mer we really discussed the money
going back in to replenishing and that's
correct possibly privatizing but I don't
think we got to that we just there was
an allocation for that to happen so um
but the capital expenditures are a
different story and they're always
separated because they're funded in
different ways Bond issues sales
tax um and then the arpa funding and do
we have any arpa funding left for Parks
no that's um we we we're spending the
last bit at West Central currently and
then we have 3 million that's been set
aside for this facility which is
probably said that but I'm having a
little trouble hearing that's okay
that's okay the Acoustics in this room
is not perfect um so anyway that's
that's the way we've always looked at it
and um as you know we tried to do a
sales tax uh we did a sales tax
initiative um that came up in the
general election and it was turned down
um and I guess there probably were a lot
of reasons why one of them is the
economy um
so I don't know what the mayor's plans
are to go forward with that but honestly
in order to move the city to The Next
Step uh there's going to have to to be
um some sort of Revenue that's going to
come in and and fund things and the the
park system was a big piece of that
sales tax I mean there was money to hman
uh there was money uh for event centers
two event centers um so it was a it was
a comprehensive package that would have
impacted the parks so we'll have to work
on that I guess gain confidence from
the citizens hopefully the economy will
do better than what we're projecting it
uh we're we're saying status quo um but
any
additional dollars in this budget have
basically gone to salaries for police
and
fire probably said more than what you
wanted to know
but I don't mind thorough responses
that's
wonderful the only reason I was asking
about the the bond or the separate
capital is for parks and W if we're
developing a new this building right is
getting
redeveloped there's going to be new
staff and things that impact the
operating budgets I didn't know how
that I don't know if all the different
departments are that way but parks and
wreck especially when they're adding
things to a park or expanding a park
there's more operating cost that go with
that so I didn't know how that gets
balanced by you guys and I don't know
that that was projected into the budget
was it Leen so if you recall I gave a
presentation on the senior facility and
requested funds for Staffing and
operation of the senior facility um the
that was not budgeted for
2025 however um we have not finalized
our bidding for the project and I
believe the situation is is that prior
By Us by the time we actually have the
facility up and running the goal would
actually be is to budget all that for 26
we will have operation and and and some
um Staffing because this facility is
already budgeted and this is the
facility for the senior facility um so
we're working towards
2026 I'm sorry say do you think that
those costs would hit in 2026 they will
the goal the reason I presented it and
and for 2025 was I was hopeful that we
could uh fill out our staff and go on
and hire
or the Staffing for the senior facility
so that they could already be here and
be ready um but I understand budgets are
are what they are and we're moving
forward and we're we're working that out
um I want to clarify one thing I don't
know if anybody picked up but vice mayor
um brought up prioritizing the golf
courses that is just a concept right now
that we're looking into um that we
haven't even started yet but back to the
some of the presentation there where
we're looking at how do we private
partnership different things or whatever
that is um there's just been the board
brought that up in one of the hearings
was to look at um what are some
different opportunities for the golf and
and so just if somebody was watching
this or listening um just to help
clarify that that process hasn't started
and it's only a um consideration at this
point it's a lot of discussion about
Parks it's just the only have so much
money you know and it's got to be
stretched across the whole
city if there aren't any other um
questions on the budget I know that was
quick but the uh the whole budget
document for 2024 is online the 2025
will be online I'm I'm sure soon I
encourage everybody to go look at those
um and uh you can come up with a lot
more questions I'll move on to uh the
next item on on my agenda uh which you
all had asked for us to present on a
kind of a year in review highlights um
Britney who youall all knew has uh
recently left but she was able to make
this at the very end and I'll just go
through this relatively quickly um I
think y are have seen majority of this
throughout the year um but this just
kind of gives us a little bit there's a
lot of stuff in here you can't capture a
whole year of what we do in in one
document and then a f- minute
presentation but we'll just flip through
these real quick and um we can make this
document available to everybody as as
well um just starting off so branding
was a really big thing for us Britney
was new to our office and we hadn't had
uh Communications person in our office
and so she focused a whole lot on
getting us um focused on branding next
slide so we looked at she reworked our
uh logo she worked on our website all
that's covered in here uh worked on all
of our social media getting all of our
brand information out there and all the
same um and it's still going to be an
ongoing process but she got us um really
headed in the right direction uh next
slide this is just one of her big slides
that she may we we use this all over
next
slide so a lot of these are um uh
different flyers from uh volunteer
events or from um shandas programs all
different things golfs up there uh we
started outdoor recreation as well um
all kinds of different Flyers but she
just put a kind of a professional touch
to them all next
slide um I'm excited about up top left
is our new parks trailer we just
finalized that so you'll see that at our
up and cominging events some of our uh
Trail signage Park signage even down to
coffee cups and different uh branding
and we got a new tent that's coming in
as well uh this is all just because we
have a story to tell and we have to
really brand what we're selling and we
want people to realize that they're
participating in a city of Little Rock
event or um a program from Parks and R
next more more um just cool stuff um
next slide so then now we get into a
little bit of events um that's um
director Lance hins and I that was
actually out at a volunteer event at
Rock Creek um our Jim Daly event bu Park
so we we had a ton of events in
2024 um I never thought I'd be in front
of the camera or microphone as much as
I've ever been um it mainly focused a
lot around the sales tax but we also had
a lot of great events next
slide I was uh left picture there is of
paint
and then I believe the other one is
might be Logan's Run which was a new run
we started down the um therapeutic
recreation started down at Murray Park
next
slide this is gives you a little sense
of all of our like a timeline of all the
different events that we either
partnered with the group or uh were
heavily involved um I'm not going to
read all of them but you can just get a
sense of of kind of the bigger things
that uh took up a lot of our time and we
were uh happy to uh be a part of next
slide lot of ribbon cuttings which is
great with using arpa funds and bond
funds uh next
slide other events um don't forget about
the eclipse I mean it seems like that
was a long time ago but that was a big
event um top left was at dumbar
Community Center we were able to do um
what was that called the planetarium
right at um dumbar for the eclipse um
bottom right I believe that's one of our
presentations for reservoir park or what
we're doing master plan so we do a lot
of community input we did a lot of
different meetings just getting
Community input and and doing popups to
make sure that the community was aware
of projects that we were um about to
start or or in the middle of to answer
questions get community feedback next
slide uh one of our bigger projects uh
that we accomplished this past year was
Jim daily Fitness um got a lot of uh
heat kind of at the beginning when it we
had to shut down the golf I mean not the
golf the uh indoor pool but we were able
to um redesign it and and get it back
open and had a successful event um in
September of this last year so excited
to see that that um has has you know
been completed and is working out well
next
slide just a little bit of of our online
presence obviously this is from
Britney's point of view so she was this
is a lot of what she was doing um but
you know she grew our Facebook when I
first started as director I think we had
6,000 people following us and she had a
goal of getting it I think uh
collectively had a goal to double that
and I think we're at 11,800 or something
so uh in one year for her to be able to
double our capacity just online is huge
um but we have to keep we have to keep
pushing that forward next
slide this is where she's talking a
little bit about our website we've come
a long way on our website I wish we
could do a lot more with our website um
it's just it's just another area that um
takes a lot of effort to to change uh we
are going online with a lot of new
things this year we're trying to do uh
not trying uh Angela could speak to this
we're doing Pavilion Rentals now online
so we're try try to uh do a lot more
online reservations and and setups
through our Active network so that
people will uh visit our website and be
able to do that and not you know not
have to always just call our front desk
um
next that might have gone back to the
beginning or
backwards these are a few highlighted
projects uh top left is our uh
Riverfront treehouse I'm really proud of
our staff um we were able to uh design
and build this addition to the Treehouse
we originally worked with PK Stanley on
the bigger aspect of it which was a
great partnership but we were able to
add this to make um a larger part of it
accessible but also it's like another um
treehouse in the trees if you haven't
experienced that down in Riverfront Park
I highly recommend it the other one is
we've been working down at uh River
Mountain Park on the Little M Mill River
and developing a boat access there for
small craft there's obviously a big boat
ramp for boats you know motorboats uh
this now allows us to have a small craft
and we have a outdoor vendor down there
uh Rock town that provides services down
there um we know somebody here that
might could speak to that more but um we
have bigger goals down there we want to
build more down there but we are uh
doing transitioning the area to
something better um as we have the
funding to do it and then Panky Park uh
as I mentioned earlier that was another
uh big um project that we redeveloped
the whole park there uh in West lck next
slide a little bit about Community
engagement kind of the same as some of
our other events but um I believe down
bottom left is at Murray Park is a what
keep Little Rock keep Arkansas beautiful
cleanup Karen probably could correct me
on some aspects of that is that right
Karen that's correct um so there's some
some other our outdoor recreation
Hindman I believe that is uh where we
did some Community input we did three
different Community uh engagement
sessions next
slide Reservoir Park Reservoir Park not
to mention 23 of the tornado but so
Reservoir Park we've worked really hard
in 24 to get it back up and going and
that's part of the master plan there of
uh Reservoir Park and we are um I think
we have finalized all the debris removal
and and fixed everything that we could
fix and now it's putting back all the
new things and we're excited to be able
to uh do those new items this year in 25
next
slide this is just finalizing a little
bit of uh some more Community engagement
um Britney was able to go to one of our
um uh groups there and give a
presentation on Little Rock Parks and
Recreation we did that quite a bit had a
lot of different presentations to
different groups some of it was based
around sales tax but some of it was just
answering questions I believe that might
be it mahogany is that it next slide a
little bit of our timeline of some of
those events um next
slide oh a little bit of media covers
not to mention the tree uh Christmas
tree which is very timely we just took
down the Christmas tree so um that's
that's down at the fifth uh fifth in
Main Street um so we work with downtown
partnership and uh Park staff put the
tree up but um we just had a lot of
media coverage this year which was
really good for us next
slide a little bit more of that some of
the projects that I've already mentioned
Jim Daly um some some improvements in
Riverfront I think that kind of wraps it
up
this is very very well done uh would
love to try to share this I don't know
if the board would would love to see
this but I don't I don't know if we can
email this to the board and everyone is
here on the commission because that's
really well done by by
Britney so I appreciate that yeah I
think um we were speaking earlier in the
master plan committee about this this
commission does need to present to the
board at some point so maybe during that
presentation there could be some
something similar to that but um anyway
if there are any other questions on just
looking back at
2024 is um is IT kan's Park is that
that's right oh
man question I think I drove by there
the other day like the parking lots
blocked off is that about to open um or
it is about to open so uh quanis was one
of our third Bond projects um so out of
the three big Bond projects that we had
in 24 is Bole Panky and quanis you
didn't see quanis in there because
quanis the playgrounds uh completed but
they and the trail is completed but we
haven't uh finalized all the side
amenities and just all the little
details uh the vendor that was supplying
the side amenities I think there's some
kind of scheduling conflict of of of
them getting them here but um our goal
is to finalize that I know if uh
director Lewis was here she'd be asking
about that too um so anyway uh good good
catch
so all right thank you
thank you
L okay I don't think we have any
presentations this month so we're going
to uh move into into unfinished business
um kind of want to go through
subcommittee ports uh I think JT you
were leading the master plan any
comments or about that
you I I'll just be brief I mean we we're
still trying to get a handle and figure
out exactly where we want to fit in the
timeline of you
know budget and and future plans that
that the department has but I think
we're getting a better handle of it we
are going to go ahead and have a
standing
meeting um one hour prior mahogany so
we're going to meet every every time
this commission meets we're going to
meet an hour prior standing meeting um
so that way you know we'll just do the
notices at the same time and uh we'll
just use that time to our best abilities
um that's pretty much
it marketing Quinton you guys have
anything um no I I did do an exit
interview with um Britney just from our
point of view and she gave me a lot of
good ideas and things that we need to
work on in 2025 I think um as Leland uh
showed us with that great presentation
is that we need to fill that position if
we can with a good person because that
got us a lot of media coverage it put us
out in the paper it just really opens up
parks and wck for other people to bring
in new ideas might not have thought of
so um yeah so I've worked with with
Britney and I look forward to working
with the new person um in this
year great thanks Sam anything on
Conservancy nothing uh new to report we
will be setting up a meeting here uh
when everybody we get a chance to get
some dates picked I'm on that
subcomittee maybe maybe we can all maybe
sit down at some point uh maybe with
Leland just to kind of give us an update
on the parts conserva I know there's
been a lot of uh there a lot of
opportunity there at the same time I
know there's been some transition with
people that are on the
Conservancy um maybe we can try to meet
maybe the same time I I would rather
meet when we meet now um so I'll get an
email sent out to everyone in that
subcommittee including mahogany wean so
great okay I just ask that you notify
the press and all that I know that
Mahogany's on that so we'll be thinking
of course thank
you um I don't think we really need to
talk about the post sales ties I think
we've we've gone over that the past
couple of months um commission ideas
goals for 2025 I I kind of put together
um you know a couple of ideas that I
kind of had in mind I I would I would
like to try to get this uh commission to
meet you know on a quarterly basis and
meet maybe at some of the the community
centers or parts just to First learn
about that asset of of L out parts and
second just to to meet
Beyond you know 12:00 at every every
month on a Wednesday so um that was kind
of a big idea I kind of had that would
would love to maybe I don't know what
the procedure is to moon but maybe just
would I have to send out dates or can or
how would that work to date and times
um you're wanting to sorry there was
multiple parts of that you're wanting to
and the first part I kind of missed but
the second part was that you're wanting
to extend the time of what you're
meeting now or I think that's a that's
another discussion but I think I I was I
would I have an idea I would love to try
to meet four times a year not that that
doesn't include this monthly meeting
that we can meet at some other parts and
community centers just to educate us on
what they do uh we hear about it all the
time but as far as actually seeing it
and touching it um so if I if I I was
planning on just putting together four
dates for the for this year each quarter
and just sending it out I'm assuming we
have to notify the press as usual as all
that yes it would it would still be a
meeting anytime we have more than one
commissioner with another commissioner
does it need to be voted on as far as
meeting or I would do that just to be on
the safe side um so if you have your
list of dates we could discuss that now
if you wanted to we could do it at the
next meeting with the dates and yeah
we'll just do it I don't have a list of
dates but maybe next morning we can vote
on the dates and uh I can send out the
dates beforehand so we have an idea what
it looks like
um but I think that's
something uh that I would like to try to
do just to kind of get a little more
Fellowship Beyond these monthly meetings
but
anyone other have any burning desires or
goals for this year
um you know there's what this Parts
partment does a lot with a little when
it terms to finance and and money so um
is there anything else you guys want to
think about or talk about please please
let us know throughout the year or
so I have a comment if I may
yeah um in the bylaws it states that
this this Board needs to give a a report
out an annual report so I would like to
encourage the commission to go on and
and decide when that is going to be and
how that's going to be developed um and
then I would be able to work with
um the board to make time on the agenda
to figure out when you can come present
it yeah they need to see that
presentation you did
today that shows all the highlights of
the parts and what's what's happened
through the year because we don't always
hear about it yeah and I think it's I
think it's pretty cool I think it was a
great
presentation and I'd like for y'all to
do that at the board
level so if I may say maybe it's a um
beginning of the year type report and
then end of the year yeah okay and the
end of the year would be more based
around maybe not truly the end of the
year but um
advising on the budget for the parks
department see some one of the things
that one of the reasons I'm here today
is because uh I'm hearing from my
constituents about some parks that are
not being addressed or taken care of and
um so you know we go through the year
and then we get to the end of the year
and Leland and other directors come and
say well I've got this problem with
whole 13 you know at the golf course or
I can't keep the I can't keep the Pro
Shop open I don't have enough I don't
have enough U money to keep that going
it's great if we can have information
throughout the year so when we get to
the end of the year we kind of know what
we're looking at instead of being you
know hit at the end of the year and then
we look at what the mayor presents
forward and so we don't have that
inherent knowledge to um understand what
he's doing understand what you're doing
uh I just think it's real important that
um this commission keeps in touch with
the board uh with
reports okay yeah we
um we have to vote today to on what do
we need to put together report first I'm
assuming beyond what you just showed us
as far as the annual report what would
you
recommend I think um the the
presentation I just gave uh would be
great but at the same time I think it's
um you know upon this board to to figure
out a way to develop a report based off
of your information I don't I don't want
it to be just a another report from
myself yeah true I want to try to make
sure that it's from the commission so
I'm happy to help and staff can be a
part of that or however yall see it fit
but um I leave it to you all to make
that decision I always get muddy on
emails and whatnot and meetings but to
me the easiest thing would be could I
start on it and email it out and people
can make send it on like a Google word
and people and the commission members
can make tweets to it or do we have to
meet to to It's Complicated um so it
would probably be best if you went ahead
and started the document however you
wanted to and then we send it to
Mahogany she can send it out and then at
the next meeting everybody get together
and then we can discuss our comments and
edits and then um we can kind of go from
there if you guys want I think you could
even um if you can make the edits live
time I and I don't want to speak out of
term because I do want to do a bit of
research before I tell you this for sure
but I think you could even um say yes
this is what we want to do and vote on
it at that point in time if you guys can
are all in agreement but I will confirm
that and have a definite answer for you
next week
okay okay
then Ben when do you plan to get your um
edits to us like like a week in advance
or two weeks yeah I mean I'll try to do
it you know a week in advance of the
nuts partk commission I'll just kind of
review the minutes and I've made notes
at every meeting and um I'll review that
and I don't want it to be too detail
maybe I'll put together like page page
and a half
um keep it simple the only thing would
add to is I I think you talked about the
summer program but I think this
commission was really impressed how the
summer program ran this year and I think
we need to emphasize that to the board
because I mean we asked a lot of
questions we got a lot of great answers
I think Shanda did a great job so I want
to emphasize that
okay um yes sorry um just as
commissioner whites side just did if
anyone else has any suggestions this be
a prime time to get them there we'll
make your live time live and trans um
edits in real time next month much
smoother and faster process
okay any other comments for the E
review I think the capital updates that
you guys have given us a few times have
really been good like on here's the
outcome from boil park or the outcome
from hany or whatever I mean I think
those are good just to highlight and I
think they were like a picture but to
sort of show here's the dollars that
were impacted same thing that you guys
did at uh
um
dunar where you noted hey we just spent
half a million on the roof but we
identified what was it $8 million worth
of Maintenance that needed to be done at
that facility to keep it up to date just
some things like
that and then also what about
emphasizing Kanis Park I didn't see a
lot I mean I I could it was going pretty
fast so I couldn't read it all but I
thought that was a big deal you know
with the basketball courts and the
pickle ball courts and all the usage of
all that I mean that thing's slammed you
if you don't drive by there you would
never know it so that was a multi-year
project that I think sort of shows you
guys having a vision and it got
implemented over time as funds were
available and I think that's a good
highlight as
well then it start Park wasn't that
funded by some grants that you put
together there was a grant involved in
that from uh the federal government it
was for um FMA or Emergency Management
because we replaced the roadway into the
park uh if you recall whenever it would
rain the fire department would go by
there and close the gate I know Mike who
goes there every day is probably very
thankful that it you know it's open now
um we built a bridge over the creek and
so now you don't have to drive through
so that's from a emergency standpoint as
well as a sustainability standpoint uh
so that was the funding um the rest of
the park is what you might be recalling
too is the playground the skate park and
um both of those had grants and then the
pickle ball uh group helped raise funds
for the uh lights for the pickle ball um
so it's a real you know a Melting Pot of
diversity of different user groups but
also funding mechanisms so that tells
the story too I mean that's a big story
sorry um we're about five minutes from
one we like to I know we say this every
time but maybe this is a good time to
talk about sending parts and maybe try
to votee on it I I mean selfishly I
would rather start earlier 11:45 and end
at one as opposed to sending Beyond one
I just got first I've got meetings that
usually start at 1:30 like today after
probably leaving at 1:15 usually so I
would like I'm just going to goe and
vote and say can we put a vote to start
meetings at 11:45 now because people can
because it takes time if you get here at
noon you got to get lunch and we we
don't start on time so I think given a
15 minute buffer at least a start will
maybe help us end at one
um can I just put it to a vote Simone
for 11:45 start going forward you can go
ahead huh 11:45 are you okay I'm
sorry all right start the meeting at
11:45 instead of
noon start the meeting at 11:45 we
currently start the meeting at
12 so it's 15 minutes
earlier is that I'm probably should have
po te hogy first as far as lunch and
getting everything ready I'm I didn't
think about that I'm
sorry
yeah
okay
okay
um is there a reason because of lunch or
oh okay I I could bring I could address
that now just as a part of your uh
decision making here so as as I've
discussed it several times this facility
is about to close because of the senior
uh construction it's still a few months
away um depending on successful bids and
all that good stuff so we don't have to
make a final decision now but I like to
um not make it at the last minute and so
point is is that it's at at some point
we will not be meeting at this room
anymore um the other commissions the
board everybody's moved on um and so
we've we've kind of held out because
this is our facility um that being said
we need to find a new facility to be
relocated um one of the easiest ones for
staff and for us would be to move to the
boardroom at City Hall however that
creates a few other challenges um it's a
little bit harder for um general public
to get there right just because of the
nuances of the building um but the
bigger challenge that mahogany have
found out and maybe there's a way around
it is is the lunch that we all enjoy um
and there's not this table set up there
um yes a majority of yall would be able
to sit where the board sits so we could
figure out some of those nuances but
those are are challenges and so we could
we could move to another Community
Center uh We've utilized Southwest
Community Center before as well um
anyway I open that up for discussion to
say ultimately you need to figure out a
another location and then that even
takes it as far as because I brought up
the idea around lunch is that we don't
always have to be around lunch and then
we wouldn't have to do the lunch hour
and all that but again um this is all
for you all to vote on and and um I can
provide you different locations and
different options so what's the latest
we need to vote on it come again what's
the latest we need to vote on
it um we would I think we need to be
able be out of here plan our um meeting
in April needs to be in another
location don't why don't you get us some
options for location and let's table
this extended time discussion until we
get those up okay so I I'll have them
presented next
uh meeting in a written document you
know locations and and options and
stuff okay um the new business is there
approved budget review have we we've
done that
already I would say that the yeah the
presentation I gave was budget
review okay
um so you want to just move on to agenda
items for that's meeting I think we've
kind of gone over a couple that we want
to continue to talk about um for next
for next month including the year room
review report as well as potential
meeting at other
places um anything else for the agenda
for next
month I would suggest that in your
report because I would like to be able
to give the presentation that you just
saw if that's going to be part of it if
if I'm going to be a part of it that's
up to you but
um you know no later than say March
because I think if you go much farther
than that it's not it's too late so I
think you really need to have it on the
agenda to finalize whatever the
direction is in February and then I can
make the request to okay do it either
late February or early
March can we or can you for on our
behalf put something forward to the City
Board just saying we're going to have a
presentation in February like towards
the end of I can definitely just front
run it right like we're going to have
something finalized to be able to
present
absolutely
okay oh yeah well Ben and I did meet um
and had you know a small meeting about
goals and I don't know if you were going
to share some of that or do you want to
discuss that next I think we'll probably
just discuss that next next time um I
kind of talked about it a little bit in
the unfinished business about about
commission ideas and goals but maybe we
can table that to nut's business so I
think I think extending or starting
early for these meetings might just
might be better because it seem like we
do this every month um which is a good
thing because we're we're talking and
not just being silent so um I'd like to
share one more um apologize that we had
to move the meeting to this week but we
had a mayor's Retreat uh for all the
directors that conflicted last last week
so appreciate it everybody been able to
uh come today to the
meeting um nice mayor W do you have
anything for Bor leaz on
or I'm actually not the leaz on or do
you have you want to talk about anything
still Cy you know what I meant Andrea
and uh I'm just you know I'm just
excited about the work that you guys are
doing like to know more about it as I've
said I've had constituents that have Ted
to me about hman park and if you've ever
been out there you know it's an iconic
Park and it has lots of potential and
and possibilities and then they see
kana's Park you know it's getting all
this new stuff so where's hman and the
mix of things and I say well there were
some grants put together and you know
that's how that happened well how come
we don't have grants for hunman you know
so I just and I since I'm not intimately
involved with you all uh and maybe I
hear about things every once in a while
I just wanted to uh come and get caught
up with the work you're doing beautiful
presentation of what happened last year
um excited about what's going to happen
in the next year and that's really the
reason I'm
here thank you for being here I'd like
to address that one one Heyman does have
a lot of things going on just not maybe
not everybody is aware and there there's
actually one of the largest grants that
we've ever received is in hman of over
$3 million so um maybe it's just an
opportunity that we come and present at
one of the neighborhood meetings and and
listen to some of the concerns and give
some more feedback so um one of the
things that's going on is
the the people that are participating in
hman are not always the best folks
they're shooting guns and right doing
things like that so a community St I
think if there's more activity then that
would keep the bad guys out and I know
it's locked up at night but on the
weekends it's open I've had several
reports of
gunshots um actually seeing people with
rifles in their hands you know this kind
of thing so
um you know just just um I just have
concerns about the
inappropriate things going on in the
park and if there's more going on then
that would that would eliminate some of
the bad things that are happening I mean
it was every Sunday I think it was
during deer season or squirrel season I
don't know which one we had individuals
with long rifles in the
park um so anyway that's why I'm here I
just want to be able to say from my own
standpoint this is what we're doing this
is where we are this is where we're
going and that kind of thing so that's
why I'm here
thank you I think with that we'll end
the meeting and um I know did this a
couple times last year but I'll try to
send a recap this week so it's all
freshing our minds of what to talk about
for next month but thank you all for
being
here what's going on at first is just
