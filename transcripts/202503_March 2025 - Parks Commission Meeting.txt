said up previously they didn't hear. If
you want to repeat that real quick. Oh.
Okay. Yes.
Welcome to the March uh commission
meeting.
Um, before we get into roll call, Ron
Bar announced his resignation from the

Thank you.
Okay.
Um, can we get approval of January and
February meeting minutes? Um, since we
didn't have quorum last month in
February, we have to approve both the
January and February. So, can I get a
motion to approve both January and
February meeting minutes?
Yes. Motion to approve. Motion by
Samuel. Can I get a second?
Second by
Sam. All
right. Oh, can we
vote? All those in favor say I. I all
opposed.
Okay. Minutes have been approved. Um the
next uh agenda item is citizen
communication. Do we have any citizens
here that would like to
communicate?
She don't think we have any citizen
communication.
Okay, the next um agenda item
um is is uh staff reports, judge
reports, and events. Um in your packet,
as they always do, they um sent over the
um the meeting their their reports uh
that uh for
uh for this past month. if you have any
questions. Um, I know Justin created
some pictures which are pretty cool. Um,
and then so yeah, any
any any I guess me hand over to you
Leland to talk about that, but any
questions on the on any of the reports
uh that were that's in your packet.
I saw that they hired um someone new at
Resmond Golf. Is it fully
staffed? I was going to speak to
that if
um yeah, I'll get to that just and
then I'd cover that, but I I kind of
have
a an agenda like to roll
through and if I don't answer your
question. Yeah, sounds good.
Any comments, questions uh on
the staff reports before I turn it over
to Leland. Yeah. What is the operation
impact? And I may just be forgetting it.
Justin, you mentioned it on the last
item on your report.
Is that something we come to or what is
the community or Yes, certainly
certainly welcome to. Operation impact
is just something the operation division
does. Um try to do three to four a year.
It's where we basically pull um all our
different uh groups, urban forestry, uh
maintenance support, construction crews,
and try to spend a really focused two to
three days in one park. And it's
something that we can publicize and push
out on social media just uh to help us
make a bigger impact um all at once.
Yes,
good afternoon. I would like to announce
two exciting uh new events coming up. Um
first, we are having a tree planting
event, our first tree planting event in
Rock Creek Trail on April 5th. Um, the
KKKAC, a local nonprofit focused on
agriculture in the state, has received a
grant from the US Forestry Service
Department or thousands and thousands of
trees that we're going to work on
replanting over the year. But on April
5th, we are specifically planting 12,000
oak
saplings. This is a perfect event for
family because they're so small. uh
children can come and dig a little hole
with a TR and and pop um a tree in. So,
please come out that day. We'd love to
have you. It starts at 9 at the trail
head behind the Comet Cleaners and we
are serving lunch. And then I announced
this last time, but I want to say it
again that on April 26th, we are closing
out National Volunteer Week with Impact
the Rock, which is the city's day of
service. We have a project in every
single ward and we are having the
kickoff in Reservoir Park and this is
our first post tornado event and we are
planting trees. Uh we are seating and
strawing and spreading mulch and as
always picking up litter. That also is
at 9:00 a.m. and we will be serving
lunch. So please I hope you can make it
out today on those two days. Thanks.
Thank you.
Um, I had another question. Justin, on
on your report, you there's a reservoir
epic playground on Reservoir Park. Where
is where is that? Like I mean, I know
where Reservoir Park is, but is it like
this is going to be like by the softball
fields used to be or are the softball
fields going away? Like, how does that
work? I know there was another
playground equipment there that was
damaged in the tornado, I believe. and
the the old playground had to be
completely removed. It was it was
damaged. This is the new uh concept
playground that we're in the process of
trying to get ordered. Um it is
customizable, which I think is really
really neat. Uh we kind of went are
going with that's not the the final
color scheme or anything, but trying to
go work with CAW on a really neat
concept. Um it is customizable and that
it'll say Reservoir Park and some other
really neat things. We've uh are in the
process of contracting with Cromwell
Architects to site locate and do some
final surveys to exactly place, but
it'll be somewhere in uh the area
probably just to the north of that park,
same parking lot where the old one was,
but we don't have exact location yet.
Thank
you.
Any other questions for our staff before
I hand over to Leland for his um
report? All
right. Lea.
Okay. Thank you.
Um just wanted to share a handful of
things. Um on in front of you is your um
personal copy of our 5-year strategic
plan. And um I would encourage everybody
to uh take that home and and read that
and then um hopefully we can have some
further conversations uh next month. But
it's a um it's an exhaustive uh kind of
visionary plan of what the department
sees as important and gives a a brief
understanding of timeline for what our
plans are for um going f forward. And
so, uh, this board here could
definitely, um, advise us on which ones
are more important or which ones are
less important in terms of timing andor,
um, it's always open for continual, um,
revisement as well. Um, in terms of my
report, always wanted to share what I've
taken to the board. Uh, just recently, I
took um, the war memorial playground
improvements. It was $100,000. it was in
between meetings here. Um but that was
on the agenda uh last night and will be
um hopefully approved uh next week. And
then uh future uh items to go to the
agenda for the board to
consider are um new fleet for resident
golf course and first te golf course. We
have some bond funds for that. Um and
staff can give more reports on that if
as needed. And then for reservoir, we
just mentioned um some of the playground
improvements. So, we have a a board
communication for the playground. I
believe it's roughly an $800,000 um
project. And then there's also um some
design um professional consultant uh
item that we're taking to the board as
well. Those are the top of mind uh
items. If staff here has any others that
I might be missing, uh please let me
know. I also wanted to uh bring up that
we had a very successful marathon event
um this um two has it been two weeks
now? Time flies. Um I actually
participated in it and got a different
uh point of view. Uh did the kids
rockers and the 5K and hopefully we'll
do more. I encourage everybody to
participate. But I always want to say
thank you to all the volunteers and all
the staff that uh did so many hours of
uh work. I mean, I know everywhere,
every staff member around this um table
here had a ton of work in it and um late
hours that a lot of people don't get
credit for. Um so, I do appreciate that
and also for all of our security for the
Little Rock PD and just everybody that
was involved and um Michael Gity and
Geneva Lamb who are our directors for
our marathon. Thank them. So, um those
cover all of our things. I think Karen
covered Did you cover the April 26
event? Okay. So, the additional event
and I'm sure Cappy would like to speak
to this. Would you like me to save
Excuse me. I'm not sick, but my
allergies are
like on steroids, so I'm doing this to
catch basically. Um, sorry. One thing I
would ask Karen is if you could identify
the other areas where we will have the
impact of event. I know it's going to
kick off in reservoir. What are the
other uh six
areas? In Ward one, we have the downtown
Little Rock streets. We are partnering
with Downtown Little Rock Partnership on
that aspect. In Ward two, it's Benny
Craig Park, Fush Creek. We are part
partnering with Ottabon Delta and
Central Arkansas Master Naturalist and
they will be there with canoes. You can
get into the water and pull litter out
of there as well as on land. Uh ward
three is Wild Wine Zoo event. Ward four
is the kickoff at reservoir which I
talked about. Uh ward five is Rock Creek
Trail and we will be planting 100 more
trees as well as cleaning up the area.
Ward six is Kanes Road and our
sustainability office will be there at
Datamax to check volunteers in and pick
up litter off that road. And then ward
seven is the animal village. I I see it
now right here in front of me in Thank
you. No problem.
Uh I I did would could I mention now
about May 21st? That's that's exactly
Yes. So, um, Reservoir Park, a a beloved
park in Ward 4, received a lot of
damage. I'm I'm so excited that we're
going to, um, focus there at Impact the
Rock Day. Uh, but in talking to Leland
and some other uh, constituents and
people that don't even live in my ward,
but live nearby Reservoir Park, there's
been a lot of public interest in a
fundraiser
uh, for Reservoir. So Leland and I have
set the date of May 21st. Uh it's going
to be at Trios, which is right next door
to Reservoir. Uh I'm happy to donate the
food in the bar. We have a private
dining room. We're going to push this
out. And really, this was brought to me
as an idea from people that live in
Foxcraftoft in the Ridge. It's the
closest park for them and their kids.
And I think we can raise a considerable
amount of money. So I hope everybody
will put this on their calendar. It's
going to be 5 to 7. uh May 21st and
Trio's private dining room which is
hopefully we will be finished with our
tornado recovery and there won't be
scaffolding uh everywhere but but I I
would really encourage you all to come
and and and help us raise money for
reservoir.
Okay, thank you. Yes, I would encourage
everybody here all the um board members
as well as well as our conservancy to be
a part of that. Um, thank you so much.
Um, I did want to mention one other
thing that we did apply, the department
did apply for a CPRG grant through Metro
Plan uh for War Memorial Park. I can go
into more details of that uh next month
if we uh want to report on that, but
that was a I think it was almost like a
$3 million ask for us. And we also
supported the Rose Creek uh initiative
um which is in Rose Creek Park, but the
Rose Creek Initiative, which is a group
that is supportive of that location, uh
actually did an application and applied
and then we had to um agree to that and
support that. So that each of those
right now are more environmentally
focused on the carbon footprint, all
these different things. And so they're
really focused on trees, the creeks, the
green space, property, all kinds of
different things. So that's an exciting
um item for War Memorial if we can get
that. And then there's an additional
grant uh coming this uh in the next
couple months where we can add
infrastructure to that on top of that.
So we would be looking at trail
infrastructure at War Memorial and trail
infrastructure for Rose Creek Trail. um
which I know many of y'all have heard us
speak to that. Anyway, I would like to
move on to some exciting news, which is
our employee news. We have uh two new
staff and and they're listed here and uh
or one in there is Sue. I don't see Sue
here, but she's not new. She's been here
for uh what to 40 years. So, um I'm not
going to mention much about her. She's
just taken an interim role to fill one
of our our spots. But I'd like to start
by introducing um Michael Ingram. He's
here u in the blue and I'd like him to
introduce himself and then right behind
that uh Graham Brown which is over here
on the right. If you all would u make
your way to the podium just to give a
few words. But I'd like to say that
Michael Ingram is our uh facility
supervisor. He's been promoted from
assistant facility supervisor at Resmond
Golf to the facility supervisor at
Resmond Golf. He has a long history in
golf and merchandising and concessions
and I'll let him share that. But we've
also um you ask about our fill out. So
we do his his position or role is now
vacant obviously as an assistant. So,
we've actually completed interviews on
that and um I don't believe we're at the
point of where we've the other people
have accepted, so I won't share their
names, but we have picked out another
candidate for that to fill that role as
well as some um additional part-time
help for some other candidates that we
found through the process. So, we're
really excited about building out a new
team to carry Resmond Golf to the next
level and continue its um you know,
championship level there. Um and then
Graham Brown, who will who will step up
in a second, he's our new parks data and
marketing coordinator. So, he's taking
over somewhat of the role of what
Britney used to do for us. Um but we
modified that. I modify those positions
and so he's actually now in the process
of hiring a social media um position
that will be under him and that's how we
change those things around. Um so I'll
let him introduce and share a little bit
about himself but I'm excited that we
have these new um well Mike's not new
but we have this new direction in terms
of our uh employees. So Mike Yeah. So
good afternoon everyone. I want to first
voice that I'm incredibly grateful for
the opportunity to lead Revsman Golf
Course. I've had two years of service at
Revsman Golf Course as the assistant. Uh
during which time we've done tremendous
strides as far as increasing revenue.
Um looking forward to this year to
expanding on some of the improvements
we've made over the past two years, but
also expanding further into not just
revenue focused items, but to quality of
life items for our golfers. Um, in the
past, Revsman has hosted the parks
commission golf tournament, but
unfortunately in the year of 2024, we
did not. Um, I'd like to invite on
behalf of Rebman Golf Course, the parks
commission to return and have their uh
fundraising golf tournament. I I believe
this tournament is a great opportunity
for the parks commission to raise funds
and for the commission and the public to
experience one of the facilities that
the parks commission supports. U. So,
with that being said, I I would enjoy if
if you guys could come back out again
and we can have that tournament for you
all.
Um, that's all I've got.
Hey,
M. Have you thought about I know it was
a couple years ago was in it was in May
of 2023 and I know a previous commission
member kind of led it as far as getting
teams and I think I I think the
commission meeting commission members
can help gathering teams, but as far as
logistics and food
and all that, is that something that you
could do? What would you want
specifically the commission? I think we
all know a lot of people in Little Rock
and can help put together teams and and
for your for the commission members that
weren't there, this isn't a a huge
tournament. I mean, I think we had maybe
15 20 teams a couple years ago, but it
does raise money for the current
conservancy
u which actually know actually raises
money for the summer playground summer
Yeah. playground
program outings that they have to go to.
So, it is important and I'm very
supportive of helping out. I just we
just we just might need some guidance of
what you need from us just because we're
all working full-time jobs and we want
to make sure we kind of use our time
wisely and effectively. So, absolutely.
So, I I would love to partner with uh
the commissioners to get this tournament
off the ground and running. Um, for food
and other items, we have our, uh, parks
uh, concession supervisor, Eileen Davis,
is new to that role. Uh, she's been
handling a lot of the catering items.
So, as far as catering goes, we can
handle that on our end at Rebsman.
Um, so, as far as team uh, building
teams and whatnot, we have several
tournaments at Revsman that I direct uh,
that are fundraiser tournaments that we
put on. So, I'll utilize some of the
marketing tactics that we have in order
to try to gather some teams for the
commission tournament.
Mike, how about you and me maybe meet
offline and then what I gather from you,
I can send um as an email to the to the
rest of commission members of what we've
gathered. I think it might be easier.
Um, so let's I'll exchange contacts
after the meeting and and I can come
down to Resmond and meet with you and
figure out dates and just all logistics
of it and what we can do. But I'm
supportive of it. I don't know if any
commission members have any other uh
opinions about it, but it does it is for
a good cause for for the summer
playground program. So it it doesn't it
helps provide like field trips and ice
cream and cool things during for the
kids during the summer playground
program. That's what it provides for. So
uh with that, um let's for sure meet
online. I I'll meet afterward, schedule
some time to meet, but if if any
commission members have any opinions,
please please speak up. I wanted to ask
you about the
um players that are playing down there.
like is it like the I feel like the
reputation that I feel like Resmond has
right now is that it's really crowded.
Do do you think it's crowded or is that
just like a something people are saying
or unfortunately we suffer from success.
Uh we are we are quite
crowded. Uh and that's because that one
we have high attendance numbers. We're
actually was the most attended
city-owned golf course in the state. Um,
so frequently we are overcrowded because
we are booking all of our tea times out.
Uh, this year we've we've made an
attempt to try to alleviate that stress
by partnering with Miss Karen to get
more volunteers that are um to be
marshalling to try to speed up the pace
of play. We've also went away from 8m
minute tea times to 10-minute tea times
to try to alleviate a little bit of that
overcrowdedness. Uh, obviously we want
revenue, but we also want to enjoy the
those that are utilizing our facility to
have a good time while they're there.
Have you cons been any considerations
about I know we have the the West N. Is
that still a thing? I haven't been down
there in a while. Okay. Yeah. And played
it, but um if if you had better
resources to allocate, could that be a
alleviate some of the congestion? Like
if that was actually like a you like a
real nine instead of just like kind of a
you know side nine? Yes, it could. And
it's actually something that uh I've
been partnering with with Leland on. Uh
we are for the bond money allocation for
2026, we're looking at resurfacing our
greens. Uh we'll be resurfacing the West
Nine Greens as well, but it still would
have the constraints of not having a
full regulation golf course for the West
N. But if we have better quality greens,
more likely people would be willing to
utilize that side to actually get
successful golf practice. at that side
nine or west nine, whatever it's called.
But I think it'd be cool to, you know,
soccer, golf, put something else out
there in addition to the to the other
nine. I know Burns Park does that. It's
we've been out there a few times. It's
pretty nice. Listen, I disagree with
that because I think that it would if
you had 27 holes, then he could move
people around and it would move a play a
lot around a lot faster. You see what
I'm saying? It's like people could go
from 9 to 9 to 9. You know, there's just
different ways you could do it to
alleviate the crowding and then get more
people out there, right? and then
generate more revenue. So that'd be the
whole goal. So what are the constraints?
Is it like the space? So the West 9 golf
course is an executive 9, which is not a
full championship golf course. The the
course the West 9 doesn't have any par
fives. It only has par threes and par
fours. So the length of the course isn't
long enough to be a regulation course.
Um so people typically our clientele
likes to golf on the championship course
because it's more of a full-size golf
course. Is that just space limitations?
space limitations. Yes. And who who owns
the rest of the space? Is it the parks
or is that somebody else? I'd love to
speak to this just since you maybe
directed that this way. Um these were a
lot of the ideas that were shared in the
uh sales tax initiative. Uh we had over
$10 million planned for Richmond Golf
Course for improvements. Um initially in
previous sales tax initiatives did
consider removing the back nine. Um in
this last one it was the exact opposite.
we were really going to improve upon the
back nine and look at what we could do
to do other things there as well. Um to
help with a lot of the things that
you're concerned with. Um but you know
that's not forgotten and we'll hopefully
be able to figure that out sometime in
the future. We were able to set aside uh
about a million and a half in bond
months for golf as a whole. We don't
want to forget about our first te course
and so that's what Mike was speaking to.
We're doing a lot of improvements to try
to help with things, but um we are um
utilized quite I mean we have a ton of
people down there, a ton of rounds. We
try to organize and Mike is working to
um with his marshals, but also just
understanding um getting more part-time
is one of the things that we just
mentioned is filling out our staff.
Mike's been down there for how long on
your own? About a year. Yes, sir. Yeah.
county. So, you know, there's a lot of
ongoing things, but we've made a lot of
large strides in the last couple of
months trying to get these positions
filled, putting some money towards that
and understanding what our improvements
are going to be uh with those months.
Could could we do more with the sales
tax or some bigger funds? Absolutely. Um
but we would appreciate your support.
We're also working he didn't mention
this, but we're also working on our
merchandising in our in our thing. I
know that's small, but to walk in and
not have merchandise on the walls was a
huge thing that really was a miss for
me. Um, and so the board did support
$60,000 additional out of, you know,
millions of dollars worth of requests.
We did get 60,000 for our golf course at
Resmonds and 30 of that's for
merchandising for the uh pro shop and 30
is for concessions so that we can have a
better experience. And we're looking at
uh in the middle of rebranding our
concessions right now. Uh so new name,
new menu, new new ideas uh because of
Mike's background and because of uh
Eileen Davis there as well as just
little things is we're I said all the
signs there at the golf course are all
so dated and you know just what can we
do? So we have a sign package. We're
updating all the signage. Um there's
always more we can do down there. Um,
and we're we're limited in some aspects,
but we're doing um I I believe we're
doing a lot trying with what we have.
So, um, all good conversation. I
appreciate it.
Thanks, Mike. Thank you, Graham.
Hello. My name is Graham Brown. I'm the
new marketing and data coordinator. Um,
super thankful to be in this role.
Excited to get started. I think we have
a lot to build off of with what Britney
did. Um, my experience is project
manager for a couple different marketing
agencies the past few years and prior to
that uh social media manager for a
couple different companies. So, I'm
going to use that experience to improve
our social media profiles and reach uh
residents in different ways such such as
flyers and different things. Um, and
then on the data side of things, I'm
going to be looking at and analyzing all
the things that various divisions are
doing and finding ways to collect and
analyze that to um just improve all
across the department.
This is going to sound random, but it
would be really nice if on the parks and
wreck website there. And it it's going
to sound funny, but an AI chatbot that
actually had all the parks and what you
could do so that someone can say, I want
to play, I don't know, pickle ball,
right? And it tells you, you know, where
you at or here's the five parks that do
it. I mean, some some of that basic if I
know we have that data that would be a
really I would think simple plugandplay
because some of that on the website it's
hard to even find at the rec centers who
who has youth basketball who doesn't or
what times or just some of that fed into
a simple chatbot for 20 bucks a month
and put it on a website would be huge.
Um I know the city is coming out with
their new AI assistant. Gotcha. I can
look into if we can also I'm not sure
how far that'll go into the site. I
assume we could probably get access to
that as well and do some things with our
site. Okay. It's just it I've been using
it more and more in different
uh non- business but
other things I work on on the side. And
it's when you guys have a database like
you do. Mhm. And even these updates feed
so much information. It's a great way
for people to even be able to query it
like what's going on or what's new and
you know get that those kind of answers.
Yeah, we'll definitely look to do
something like that in the next couple
years.
Anything else for
Graham? Thank you. Thanks, guys.
Appreciate y'all giving us a little more
background. Look forward to working with
you
all. Okay. Um, next agenda item is
presentations. I don't think we have any
today. We have a pretty full slate of
new business, so probably a good thing
we don't have any presentation just for
the sake of time. Um, I'm going to go on
to unfinished business. Um, I will start
with uh JT on the uh subcommittee for
the master plan. Looks like y'all met
today. We did. Um, had a good meeting.
Um, our plan for next month is to uh
come up with a list of priorities to and
action items to present to this body. Um
that's going to include
um
prioritizing mainly what we think is
going to give us the biggest bang for
our buck um with limited resources. So
um look forward to that. That's going to
it will of course incorporate this the
items in the five-year strategic plan.
Um so we're going to digest that this
document as well. um and and make sure
that you know
any suggestions we come up with are in
line with this plan. Um a couple things
we did want to request.
Um Ann, did you want want to go over
that list of Yeah, sure. And it would I
think Mahogany would have access to most
of it. Um, but it's the strategic plan.
If we can get a digital copy would be
great. But then also the u uh we
discussed the indoor indooroutdoor
u facility that was looked at for war
memorial as far as like a youth sports
uh complex if we can get some of the
background
uh in in a digital format on that. And
then also any of the parks and wreck or
uh little rock convention visitor bureau
reports that have been like the last
year or two that are sort of helpful to
this aim in a digital format just so we
we have them and can sort of go through
them um and any of the consulting
reports uh that supported the sales tax
proposal related to parks and wreck
would be helpful just so we can start
trying to get our arms around that data.
Hey Canon, can I confirm that with you?
You had the strategic plan the then a
war memorial which one? Well, that
that's more on that sales tax report.
Just any of the consulting reports that
were sort of supporting Right. Okay. War
Memorial any of the other like bigger
projects that were part of that sales
tax movement and say because we got away
from Memorial for the indoor outdoor so
right it moved to East Little Rock or
Jason President Clinton. Right. But the
the previous stuff in war memorial I
think would be helpful too if that's
going to be part of our discussion
whether that was part of the sales tax
or not. We fair enough. I can we can
from previous years. Sure. Yeah. I think
it just helps us get a
decent even working knowledge or
baseline of like if someone said hey
let's do 10 fields what was the budget
or you know swag on what that would
call. I mean just to sort of get heads.
Yes. Gotcha. Thank you.
All right.
Um, next one is Sam. Anything on the
parts conservancy? So, our subcommittee
has not met yet, but I did get to talk
with their uh, secretary and of course
like Stacy Hurst about their meetings. I
did not get to make it to their last
meeting that was um, March 5th, but I
did have their their meeting notes. uh
we're going to start planning to attend
these meetings so that we can not just
be handing notes back and forth but also
be there in person. And uh from what I
understand about the meeting on March
5th, um I think Cappy had the biggest
new business that she's already talked
about. Um so as far as our subcommittee,
we will be getting together and uh
starting to figure out when and who we
can go to these meetings and take turns
or see how we can make that work. But
their next meeting is April
2nd. Um, so we plan or I plan at least
to be there. Where are they held at? Um,
I'm not sure yet. Um, different
different places. A lot of times they'll
meet at Trios. If the if nobody's in the
private room, I just let them use that
room. That's why I'll be attending on
April 2nd for the trios, you know. Well,
then I'll make sure room is available.
But um we we plan to start getting more
involved with those actual meetings
instead of just um talking about their
own meeting notes.
Okay. Thanks, Sam. All right. Marketing.
Uh
Quinton, no report this month, but we do
plan um to meet with Graham um as we
just heard this coming month and work
with him to get something going.
Okay.
Um, I think the rest of the the
unfinished business topics are going to
be discussed in new business. So, if
anyone anyone's okay with that, we're
just going to go straight to new
business. Go straight to new business if
that's
okay. Okay. I don't see anything
opposed.
Okay. So,
let's So, news business, we
have I know eight seven to eight bullet
points. Um I think the first and third
ones are want to talk about right now is
um I brought this up I guess in January
and and February as well about having a
chance for us to go as commission and go
meet at some of the facilities across uh
the parks. Um I was thinking quarterly
but I thinking since it's already March
maybe just meet three times in in in
2025 and it's more just a awareness and
social outing. Um, and so I've put
together
uh three dates
um in three locations with the and I
want to just kind of go over this and I
know not everyone can make it, but I was
thinking we can combine awareness and
social. So I would like to vote on these
three dates and locations as follows.
So, April
24th we would meet is it I'm trying to
do it on Thursday uh Thursdays in the
kind of afternoon evening. Um April 24th
at MacArthur Park just to learn more
about that park and learn about all the
surrounding areas, but then maybe go to
um AMFA and maybe just have some uh some
drinks there um cocktails, snacks. So,
that's the first date that I had in
mind. Time. Oh, I was thinking 400 PM.
Would that be okay with everybody just
to Or we can make it five if that's
better. Um, but like I said, it's going
to be hard to get eight, nine people to
agree on dates. So, I'm trying to I'm
just picking these dates out and uh
hopefully you guys vote on. Um, so
that's the first one. Um July 10th uh
would be it's another Thursday and I was
uh deciding I want to go and look at the
summer playground program and so that
would be either
um at South Central or at Southwest or
West Central is what I was thinking. Um
I'm I I would I'm kind of thinking West
Central just to see the status of the
the ball field that's being updated and
rebuilt. So, um, West Central for July
10th and October October 9th, Boil Park,
just to, uh, kind of see everything
that's been going on at Boral Park. So,
those are the three dates. So, April
24th, MacArthur Park, July 10th,
um, West Central at 4 p.m., October 9th,
Boral Park at 4 p.m. Um, we don't have
any I was going to go ahead and vote if,
but any discussions about these before
we put this to a vote.
Not so much discussion, just keep top of
mind. It would be ideal if maybe Quinton
and I could be there unless you guys are
going to commit to getting yourselves
photos and video so we can post it on
social just to humanize us a bit. I'm
all for that. Okay, perfect. Well, vote
on. Okay.
Um, all those in favor of the dates and
locations that I provided, please say I.
I. All
opposed. Okay. So, we have April
24th at MacArthur Park, July 10th at
West Central, and October 9th at Boil
Park. Thank you all.
Um so that covers the first and third
bullets. The second bullets is a
um part of the bylaws and Simone I just
want to make sure I understand this is
we have to present to the lur board of
directors a year in review. I know it's
already March, so I would like to go
ahead and vote on the actual
presentation. I sent and I apologize. I
was very late and I sent it out last
night and I know Canyon, you had some
edits I saw in the email. So, I do
appreciate that. Can we get that pulled
up
mahogany?
Um, and
uh I'm gonna make I'm gonna add pictures
and make it look nicer. I just wanted to
get the actual copy on there. Um, but I
need y'all's help. I have to fill up any
information. So,
so I know that looks bad right now, but
I'll change the font on that. I'm not
sure what's going on, but this is just
uh you know your commission members the
next three or four slides. Can I just
Yeah, you're on the slide. There's an N
after the Yeah. on my name. Thank you.
It was 11 pm last night. So, yeah.
Uh, I'll make that change, Mike. Thanks,
man. I guess we can take Ron out as
well. Uh, next slide. The next three or
four slides is just a from the bylaw
just talks about responsibilities of the
commission. So, this of course will be
presented to um the commission at one of
the board directors meetings. And then
if you go mahogany to the first
um No, you keep on going. You're
good. You're good. So, I'll go back.
So, the first one is subcommittees
formed in our meeting.
Um, and I know uh Canon it needs to be
marketing. Uh, so I'll get that
changed. Um, I think consery is spelled
wrong too. Am I mistaken?
It is.
It's 11 p.m. last night. Thank you. All
right. Yeah, we'll get those all the
spelling changed.
Um and then so Simone, if
we can we vote on it with the expected
changes that need to be made?
Yes. So, but we'll need a motion to
vote. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So let me just go
through the rest of the slides and then
we can vote. Mah, you go to the next
slide. So this is where I'll I'll
discuss each subcommittee to the board.
Sales stats efforts. I know it didn't it
didn't pass, but I think we I think the
commission was very active in in the
sales stats. Um social media support. I
know a couple of our commission members
spoke at the little board directors
meeting in support of the sales stats
and we wrote a letter talk about that.
Um, next slide
please. Canis park improvements.
Um, so any any additions? I just was
taking this really from the online of of
all that. So, um, so could they Hey,
Simone, could they
potentially So, Canon sent me edits via
email. Can they can we vote on it
tonight? today and then I can make edits
from the emails I'm getting and then I
can be
if you're getting comments via email,
they need to be referenced today in the
meeting in order for them to go and be
for Yes. Okay. So, there was an email
from Canon
um that I'll change what he said what
he's included and I appreciate Canon
putting that together. Um if nothing on
Canis part, let's go to the next slide.
I I think the one thing on Kanis Go
ahead. Um could you read Canon's changes
for us, please? Oh,
okay. So, we talked about on the
subcommittees formed making it marketing
um instead of market and then I'll
change the conservancy to be spelled
right. Um number two
is making the colors all consistent.
Um and then we can talk and then let's
go now. Let's stay on Kanis for you
cannon. So it and my wording will be
awful and Leland can probably help me
with this um or maybe another commission
member, but Kanes Park, I think one of
the things we spoke about um in the last
few months was how that was
a and and I think he said it at the
opening that it was like there was
federal money, there was state money,
there was local, there was all kinds of
funds that have gone into that park, you
know, upgrading the playground, doing
the bridge, doing the basketball. I
mean, just various components. And um I
think that was one of those things in my
head to highlight on here that that park
is sort of a there's a lot of hands in
there helping that park and helping
rebuild the park and various aspects of
it. Um I don't know if it's worth
showing on here, but I think it's um I
think it's powerful nonetheless. I mean,
just to see the various buckets that
sort of went into fixing the park.
I would like to make a suggestion then
instead of calling it Kanes Park
improvements which makes it feel like a
very um we're showing a slide about just
one part park part project and where we
did an improvement is maybe something
where the if the commission agreed it
says Kanis Park
um something more to what you just said
like you're talking about we talked
about Kanes Park in general of how
impactful it is to compare that to other
parks and how has been successful and
how can we utilize that to be successful
somewhere else. So maybe it's not
Candace Park improvements, it's Candace
Park.
Somebody fill in that blank. But Candace
Park impact maybe title it like a
success story and then say, you know,
Candace Park as an example instead of
the whole instead of making the I mean
it's still focusing on Candace Park, but
it really be focusing on it's a model of
success based on the different
improvements you made out there. Is that
what you're saying? Yeah, exactly.
something to that degree to say, um,
wow, if we could if we could achieve
what we did, you know, over the last 5
years at Kanis Park and and XYZ Park,
wouldn't that be great? And how did we
achieve that? Well, we had influx of
capital dollars from the board for this
and from the mayor for this and grants
for that and this and we had a lot of
different user groups and the commission
has been greatly supportive and been on
board of all this.
and that story if that if that could be
the story for this slide. But again,
this is I want you all to have this as
y'all or something, you know, to that
effect. And then one of the things, and
tell me if I'm wrong, Cappy, but I
mean, Leland, you can help color in the
real numbers, but there was only x
amount of city funds actually utilized,
right? or city operating budget utilized
in that five-year process versus some
grant money from this or ARPA funds from
that, you know, I mean like how a small
seed from the city helped, you know,
majority of all the funds were grant
funds um as well as privately uh raised
funds for pickle ball um for the lights
there um and even for the Kanes the last
bit for for the basketball there there
were some federal funds for the roadway
improvements. So, um definitely some big
money from the city as well, but
um majority of it was
uh grants over the years for all the
different amenities in the park. Excuse
me. It sounds like we're going to have
some pretty substantial changes are
going to be made. Um, and it looks like
the next board meeting that we could get
placed on the agenda for is the April
15th board meeting if we have it um
there, I think by March 24th or so. Um,
so I think we could have a special
meeting virtually if you would want to
pursue that option to actually make
these changes and get that done. Just
want to throw that out there. to you as
you discuss.
Um, yeah,
Commissioner Woods, I move that we meet
virtually to redisuss our presentation
to the board. And the date on the table
is April 15th.
I believe that would be the date for the
next board meeting that we could meet.
Um, if we have any differences, I'll let
uh you know it whenever we meet. Um, but
that's the date I have. Well, so we have
to get it the presentation or the get it
on the agenda by March 24th. We have to
tell them that we want to even present
them by March 24th, I believe. That's I
was going to help cover that. Is that so
I I will present that to the city
manager, EOA, city attorney's office as
a desire that we would like this to go
on the the agenda. um depending
on all the different information that
would be already on that agenda,
sometimes it gets bumped to the next or
whatever that it may be. But Simone's
right, there is a process. We would
follow that process and it sounds like
you've already done the math, which is
sometimes difficult to look at all the
the upcoming meetings, but you know, we
would say that is tentatively what we
would be hopeful to get on, but it might
slide another two weeks. But
well, I say since spring break's the
last week of March, I say we try to meet
next week um virtually.
Um you guys just want to say the same
time next Wednesday at noon.
All those in favor of meeting that's
Wednesday at noon virtually say I.
I. All
opposed. Okay. So we'll meet if Mahagay
can send out
um a link to meet
next Wednesday at noon. Can I ask a
couple quick questions? Um, I know this
is an annual requirement that we're
trying to meet this year, but there's
not like a specific month that we were
meant to hit. Well, it's just that if
we're doing a year in review in 2024, we
probably need to do it sooner than
ladder than later. I mean, ideally, but
we don't want to rush into it if we're
not ready, right? I don't think we're
rushing into it. It's just there's a lot
it's probably this needs to be a
separate discussion. Um, my other
question was for Simone because we we're
starting to throw away around a lot of
quote meeting
dates. Are all these going to apply to
this memorandum from the bylaws? Are
they all considered mandatory meetings
that if you miss them, you start racking
up consecutive misses? Just curious
because we're throwing around a lot of
new dates to meet that attendance is
regarding conducting business and we're
not
conducting business at these site
visits.
So I just want to make sure. So are you
referring to the special meeting, the
virtual special meeting or the um
MacArthur Park visitation things in the
April, July and October? Yes. where
we're approving, you know, quote,
"Approving these meeting dates." So,
that makes them sound official to me and
I'm just wondering if you see it the
same way. To my understanding, they are
not meetings. We are not It will not
count against you. It is a special
outing. If it's a meeting where we're
conducting business, it would
um but these are just special outings.
And on that note, we did not like have a
official motion to vote on um the
meeting dates. And so I I need that
motion, please. So one motion, please.
Uh, Commissioner Woods moves that we
have a virtual meeting on March 19th at
noon to discuss our presentation to the
board. I need a motion for the July park
outings, those dates, the April 24th,
July 10th, and October 9th dates.
Okay. We need So, um, Commissioner Woods
is moving that we meet three times this
year. On April 24th at MacArthur Park,
July 10th at
Southwest and West Central, thank you.
At West Central, and then October 9th at
Boil
Park. I second that.
All in favor say I. I. I.
Thank you guys. Thank
you. Okay.
Um discuss the subcommittees. We we
already discussed that. Is there
anything that sure why it's on? Okay.
We've already discussed that. Um Simone,
can you talk about the applications for
commission vacancies? I
know there is something that you saw
that we have
to recommend
applicants. Um is this is this saying
that we have to go through each
applicant live and vote on it or
recommend? If so, I recommend we do that
during our virtual meeting next
Wednesday for the sake of time. Um, just
can you provide some clarity on on this?
Um, one moment. Let
me pull up my bylaws real quick. Um, but
our bylaws basically say that our pos
our membership positions will be filled
by the commission itself and then the
board of directors will approve. Other
commissions, it's the other way around.
Um, so you guys are in a unique
position. Um my understanding is that
you
it is now apparently it wasn't you can
discuss um the people the candidates I
believe you already have the packet the
candidate packets um so you will discuss
them make your nominations vote and all
of that and you I need to double check
real quick if a special meeting can only
be on one topic and I believe a special
meeting can only be on one topic but I
will double check. Okay.
C may I make a couple of comments and
I'm certainly not the authority but I I
have been on the board for I'm in my
knife here and you know when we go into
uh executive session to appoint people
to boards and commissions I I've never
known that the like the parks commission
would make their recommendations. We all
get a binder and basically uh the the
mayor makes the choice and then we
approve or not approve. So this is a
whole new system I've never even heard
of.
and I I I've leaged to some other boards
and commissions and that's that's never
been the case that that that an
individual commission would review the
applications and then I I don't know
make a recommendation to the board or
the
mayor. It's just odd.
Um I'm willing to I I can meet with you
offline to show you our bylaws where it
uh says that. Um I I believe you. I just
think we've never done that. I mean, we
haven't done that in nine years. I I can
speak to that. We haven't done it. And
when Simone got here, she brought pulled
me to the side and said, "This is a new
process." And I said, "Okay, well, we
need to go through it." And even Ben was
asking me like, "What is this process?"
And I said, "Let's discuss it at the
meeting." So, I think it's very fair
that we have a a healthy discussion
about it. Sure. Yeah. But, um, it you're
right. We we've never done it this way.
So, I I'm learning as well.
So, this I'm suggesting this could have
been something that was just never
caught in the
bylaws that were created prior to the
new powers of the mayor.
Uh, yes. So, these need to really be
amended or
changed to be because that the the when
these were written, the city government
operated differently.
So, I do not have the history of how and
when each bylaw was amended. I can get
that and make that um for any amendments
that would like or suggested amendments
that would need to come from Leland. Um
I
have my I can only follow the bylaws.
Yeah, I'm just I'm really just
suggesting that I think that we need to
get a little deeper into this before we
and I'm sorry to interrupt. Um I will
also say that our ordinance the that um
also says the same our ordinance mirrors
the bylaws. So it's it it's there. Maybe
can I say on that note then maybe Simone
and our board leaison Kappy here and
myself could meet offline and discuss
the bylaws and if it if they're
appropriate or amendments need to be
made.
Yes, we we can. Um, we'll just also need
to note that we'll need to amend the
ordinance if we're going before we could
amend the whatever is whatever. Thank
you. Okay,
let me ask this. So that I think there
might be a concern here. So I don't want
that to stagnate our our commission. I
want to make sure that we can meet
hopefully as soon as possible to keep
our process of bringing in new board
members uh as needed.
Okay. All right. We're at 101. We got
just a couple more. I think this is
timely discussing vote on extended
meeting
time. I don't know if we have any
discussion. I would I brought this up
past couple months. I would like to
start the meeting at
11:45. It feels like every week, which
is a good thing. We're getting we're
overtime and
um so if there's no discussion topics,
can we get a motion to vote to change
the meeting time to 11:45?
I move to change the meeting time to
11:45.
All those in favor? Second.
I know. All those in favor?
I. All opposed.
Meeting will now start at 11:45
effective April
9th. So in your packets um coming from
the bylaws, you
have membership and the terms. And I
think the one thing we want to talk
about is attendance is
um kind of just kind of wanted to talk
about the absenteeism and commission
removal,
but there's a memorandum um that was
presented by Mahogany and Leland um to
the right parts commission that they
printed out and sent to you guys via
email and which is now printed. It talks
about article
three specifically the attendance and it
says when a member has missed more than
25% of the regular meetings in a
calendar year or three consecutive
regular scheduled the member is
automatically removed from the
commission. Um the commission self
certified to city manager that the
nimmer has missed a requested number
requested member meetings. Um you guys
can read it. I'm not going to you guys
can read. So uh but anyway um just I
wanted you everyone to be aware of
uh
the
attendance policies for the uh for the
commission. If you are removed that you
do have a chance to be reinstated.
Um you can submit a letter to the board
of directors in writing prior to this
meeting if you would like to stay on the
commission. So, um, any dis any
discussion or questions, opinions about
this? But I think we just probably
should do this every year and make sure
everyone is aware
of the attendance policy here.
I just have a question regarding um
vacancies are
filled currently what we were discussing
prior
um by the commission but then if you're
removed you can petition the city board
and not the parks and rec committ. It
just sort of seems like a
little like there's you know
three-legged thing we're trying to
figure out here.
Um I don't know. Yeah. I mean that's
what's written in the bylaws. So I don't
this the city board approves right in
both situations. Yeah. So it would it
still makes sense to me but
Okay. Um any agenda items for next
meeting that you guys uh want to talk
about? Of course we're going to be
meeting next Wednesday. Talk about the
presentation. Uh, please email me
changes, edits similar to what Canon did
so we can try to get it done in a timely
manner. Um, Mahogany, can you send out
um a link for um virtual link for nets
Wednesday, please? Thank you. Any other
agenda items for nets
meeting? And just to be clear for master
plan meeting time's not going to change.
We're just going to have to be a little
bit more efficient. That sound good to
y'all?
Okay. All right. Um I'm sorry. Just Yes,
you can have multiple topics at your
special meeting. So, if those are the
two you want, go ahead. So, for next
Wednesday, we can talk about Well, I
think Cappy and Leland and Simone are
going to meet offline on the
applications.
Okay. So, we might we'll for sure
discuss the presentation. That's
Wednesday. We might add a couple another
thing if we can.
Okay. All right. Uh, Director Peek, do
you have any uh anything you want to
say? Well, I I've already mentioned uh
Erin mentioned Impact the Rock and then
the uh fundraiser for reservoir on May
21st. Uh one last thing, um you know,
litter is such a problem all over the
city, especially in our parks. Uh we had
about 600 volunteers just this past
Saturday. I led a group at Push Creek
and we made a lot of effort. Then, you
know, it's going to look the way it did
in about a week from now that it did
before the cleanup. But if if you're
interested in uh getting your kids
involved or if you've got high school
kids that need need volunteer hours, uh
now all the libraries have litter pickup
kits. They're free. You can check them
out. All you have to do is have a
library card and it would include trash
bags and gloves and litter picker
uppers. So, that's kind of a fun uh
volunteer project for uh you and your
family to consider. And uh if you're not
in involved in the Pick It Up campaign,
which I'm leading, uh we are getting
some momentum. And for those of you that
have HOAs and POAS, if you could
encourage your neighbors to adopt a
street, uh that's been very impactful.
And it's super easy to sign up. uh
that's uh is operated out of our public
works department and you can follow the
link to adopt a street
or a park or a highway or a flower
bed trails. You can pretty much adopt
anything on that except maybe children.
Thank you. Anything else? Director Peek
