right um citizen communication do we

here I think that's you
please uh if you have anything to say or
show if you want to go up to the podium
and state your name and while you're
here I think don't you have a
presentation or a slide was emailed over
via PowerPoint I don't know I guess it
was supposed to
be maybe prepared yeah MOG working on it
right now if you want to go ahead and
can I say your name and where you live
and why you're here and we can yeah so
my name's Nolan Hughes I am am a little
rock resident residing in Walton Heights
neighborhood um we are oh there's the
PowerPoint uh we are have been
fundraising for the last 40 days to put
together the South Ridge Terrace Garden
Park initiative uh and it's would be as
considered a private public uh
partnership between our neighborhood and
the City of L Rock uh we have raised are
you able to click the next slide
um so this it's it's a city-owned
property it's an important piece that
connects uh the Two Rivers Park uh the
bike trail that was designed I guess two
years ago and installed that runs across
the road of South Ridge in our
neighborhood that goes down to connect
to Connor Park uh at the bottom or
towards u iway 10 uh these are the
slides rendering if you can go to the
next
one uh next one
this is where we're at as of today so we
did a Kickstarter campaign uh primarily
just for our neighborhood residents we
have about 500 homes in the Walton
Heights area there is no uh public uh
Gathering space or communal space for
parents or children uh to hang out and
so the South Ridge
Road um is just narrow and this is the
only real piece of property
that we could um potentially designate
for a common area that could both
benefit the citizens of Walton Heights
but also the visitors that are coming in
to mountain bike uh and then um that
they have to use our uh South Ridge Road
to load and unload bicycles there is a
small parking space in front of there
and so we're looking just to beautify
this area it's currently just overgrown
with privet and just vegetation it's
really unused land so we're looking to
make an investment and an improvement to
the parcel um and we've currently raised
around $112,000 we have 45 uh backers
with five days to go we're hoping to
land just around
15,000 uh that we're looking to invest
into this parcel that the city of L Rock
owns is that is 15,000 the is that phase
one are there multiple phases I'm pretty
sure there are multiple phases um and
that's why
you know I'm here and we're here to to
talk about how how we could work
together to to build this out so phase
one 15,000 we've already got the those
expenses covered for like the boulders
rocks
landscaping uh chest tables picnic
tables so 15,000 will cover the bulk of
like the initial Phase One cost um
outside of like going further deeper
into the property with like slides and
like more groundwork um so yeah phase
one should
be pretty easy to accomplish in my
opinion any uh any
questions right
now hey Leland what so what
can partnership perspective I know it
all comes down to money but what what
can the part do to
help move this forward if if any is it
is
it gota get in the budget for next year
or sales taxs or all the above I'll
speak to that briefly so um I've shared
with the group in the neighborhood and
they've been following right in in line
and footsteps and coming up with design
work they uh completed a popup in the
neighborhood um I participated in that
there was a lot of
neighborhood uh that came out in support
of it um I've said from day one that if
they were able to raise some money uh i'
would be hopeful to be able to match a
little bit of that it really depends on
future revenue and funding that the
parks department we would to receive in
next year and sales tax and you know
different um funding sources such as
that um the biggest thing is is that we
could help with some aspects of it maybe
some of the boulders or some aspect ECT
of the phasing of the approach um we
always want to be supportive of uh
neighborhoods that are raising money on
their own for um new park and new park
uh you know experiences so very I'm very
supportive of the whole plan I think
they've a great job on the you know
presenting particularly what is this
your third or fourth presentation to
this group yeah yeah Ryan's Tak the lead
he just had twins La this week so I'm
filling in for
uh for Ryan on this one but yeah we've
we've spent countless hours canvasing we
do have as you can see on the board for
next month the park cleanup event at the
trail head so the goal is to kind of go
in get the pushy plants and remediate
the the privet and the invasive species
and kind of kind of start the cleanup
project and then start working with the
suppliers uh on the raw materials such
as like the boulders the picnic tables
and the outdoor chest table
um
yeah great thank you well appreciate the
continue update in
progress um moving on to direct report
staff reports events um any questions on
the staff reports that were sent out by
mahogany on Friday it's um you know
Recreation
safety um Administration
and operations any
questions uh I'll know reports before I
handing over to Leland to to get into
his
report yeah regarding the summer youth
program we talked about
it prior to the
summer and if I'm adding it up right it
looks like there's three or 400 kids at
least maybe
500 is there a total number I'm just
trying to add them all up real quick
and make sure I'm getting them all right
for the different I know there's
different camps that may may not count
it's a week or two week or not the whole
summer
y if you like Canon I would recommend
that the you or you know the commission
would ask for a presentation on our
summer playground program or or summer
you know since it's you know as a wrap
up for the
summer yeah that would be good is that
your request request that yeah I would
like to have that I mean I think it's
something
that uh anyway I'm glad the city does it
I wish I think we've talked before and
I've talked with schwand offline on just
a funding it seems like and sometimes
space you know depending on the
community centers but um it never seems
like they have enough slots you know
like there's always kids that would take
slots if they're created kind of thing
uh so the slots fill up very quickly
it's $100 to participate and it's
um yeah we would be able to do more we
use pit funding to uh fund it and we've
had the same amount in pit funding
for as long as I been aware of so as you
can imagine that me meaning the same it
doesn't change with inflation we get if
it's $100 $200,000 a year for p and
that's not just used for summer
playground that's used for all of our
different programming across our
department so okay what's pit standing
for prevention intervention uh
treatment okay if shaana can be there
next month I think it'd be great to have
a a presentation on that next month in
September if we can put that on the
agenda under
presentations I would I mean I would see
this as something too that
once we see the report I mean if it's if
there's 800 kids there's likely 800 more
that would do it and I mean it gets back
to what do we do as a commission and
recommend to the city board and to you
guys you know on if it's worth if it's
effective if it's worth expanding that
kind of thing yeah actually um there's
even more of a discussion there um and
we could get in this when she presents
but so we didn't have summer playground
at um West Central it was a newer
Community Center and there was another
Grant funded program there and that
actually moved out because of um the
FEMA moving in during the tornado it's a
little bigger story there we're not
going to go into all the details but we
restarted a new program there and um
made some changes and we plan on taking
some of those um things that have done
well there over this year or this summer
and incorporate those into our other
locations and so I'll let Shanda share
all that next
month the original program the 21st
century that's what they did have yes
this past or before FEMA was there
yes summer
oh yes that was our new summer
playground program that I'll have Shanda
give an update on that well here she is
walking in but that's so we we talked
about trying to make a um some
improvements to our summer playground
program we didn't want to do it you know
Citywide or at all locations all at once
we wanted to make sure they were
successful um and so we thought it was a
good idea to try those new things at
West Central and from what we've been
told so far um it was received very well
and so Shanda might want to pick up and
discuss some more of that but Shand
you're going to be here next month to be
able to report out on on the summer
playground
programs okay Canon here has has
requested your uh full report next month
yeah I'd just like to see I mean it's I
don't know I think it's an amazing
program and i' just like to see what was
good and it sounds like you guys did
some testing at West Central which is
awesome and so what that can be rolled
out to and then what as a city and
Community we could do more you know kind
of thing so
uh yes we're we're going to do more
outdoor recreation um implementing that
into the program and just additional
activities and things for the kids to do
all summer for seven weeks so yes okay
cool very
coolway sorry go to
you okay um so if there's no questions
in terms of um staff on projects
right so if everybody will um there's a
m Mill Pinnacle U master plan um I want
to make sure everybody's aware what this
is is a draft version of a plan that the
state and and many other stakeholders as
you see on the back cover of the front
page of who've been or who are partner
project Partners uh the city has um not
put any financing into this project at
all um but has been I've been a project
stakeholder and and been involved in
this uh the reason that I bring it to
your attention today to the commission
is that there's a handful of parks that
are associated with this the Arkansas
River Trail River Mountain Two Rivers um
natural steps could play a part of this
Conor Park this is the the bigger
version of this or the bigger master
plan concept is developing a uh master
plan of Recreation uses from say uh west
of 430 out around Lake M Mel and back as
you may or may not know there's a lot of
with our U River Mountain Trails
Pinnacle State Park Pinnacle Trails uh
Lake Mall Mill uh the uh trail system at
Rattlesnake Ridge the blue uh Blue
Mountain Trails uh there's a lot of
different recreational assets and they
all have different uh components some of
them are City some of them are state
owned some of them are The Nature
Conservancy these are all different
agencies that have been involved in this
um and they've asked us to finalize
review of this and make any final
comments before they make a final
version of this I think the deadline is
due end of next week or roughly in there
um but anyway I wanted to present it to
y'all so you can take this home take a
look at it see if there's anything that
sticks out why we did something why we
didn't do something we can discuss it
again next week this will be an ongoing
project there's C certain things in here
say like a a bypass Trail at Two Rivers
Park the Arkansas River Trail is
obviously too um heavily used which is
not a bad thing but it's heavily used so
what would it look like if we develop a
new trail that would create a bypass
around that so your input would be
appreciated on any of these ideas um in
this plan I don't know exactly the uh
Next Step that would be up to the state
the person that's at the state that is
running this is uh Katherine Andrews the
um director of outdoor
recreation and um and so I'll just kind
of open it up for questions I know
nobody's had a chance to really review
this but you've been able to flip
through it and um are there any just
general questions before we move on yeah
I have a question um leel what are your
thoughts on it have you had a chance to
review it and do you have any concerns
based on things that you're doing um or
or any you know this really highlight
some things that we're doing yeah so um
I'm very excited about it I I guess
maybe I downplayed a little bit just
I've been involved in it for so long but
um this is one of those things that if
we actually could achieve and get
funding and everybody was a partner on I
think it's one of those things that
would make Little Rock the capitol city
stand out and outdoor recreation for the
for the
state um I think it would be um a huge
achievement people would be able to come
here and and go and experience all of
our um Great Outdoors um and get a real
taste of it all from uh you could stay
downtown ride the Arkansas River Trail
and get right into the system and
experience all of it um we really have a
lot of great assets but we don't
highlight them they're all individual
this would really uh pulls it all
together and makes one major master plan
um and makes it to where also they all
interconnect and then we would also you
know do small things that are are big in
my mind but I mean such things as like s
sign standards and mapping and
understanding and connections and so
instead of having everybody have their
own little thing you know they'd all be
interconnected um I think it would be
unbelievable for us to figure out how to
accomplish it so and when you say
interconnected um just following up when
you say interconnected what I mean
somebody's got to be in charge of this
whole thing would it be Katherine
Andrews and their office um you know in
coordination with everybody but like
book stops with her is that how this
would run yeah so I mean what there's a
there's a that's a great question
there's a um an area in here where it
says who's responsible for what there's
a little chart um let me see project
list outcomes like page 85 so you can
see um if you'll look on that um one of
the first ones at the top is the Big
Damn bridge to River Mountain so there's
a concept there that from the big DM
bridge to River Mountain if you've been
on that area that's Arkansas River tra
it's essentially right now a closed road
that was originally you know a vehicle
Road okay so you know yes it's it's
functional but if you look at the plan
in here they have a we have a lot of
different ways to make it better and so
um if there's a way to you know
facilitate that outcome or find a way to
fund that then you look at partner lead
would be myself the BL Rock Parks and
Recreation right the maintenance of that
would still be under us right so this
really gives you a sense of who's kind
of responsible for what sections but it
allows us to say wow we could really put
all this together it also allows us to
apply for much larger grants and
different funding mechanisms because we
have this whole big plan and we're all
working together um and I don't know if
you know if the state hopefully maybe
one day might has have some different
funding or different Grant programs that
I'm not aware of at this time um but yes
if it was on city property under Little
Rock Parks and recre a um this this
commission would be involved in and I'd
be involved in and that's why I'm
presenting it to you today to
review is it is it like just a
connection of new trails or I guess I'm
just trying to I haven't maybe missing
the right you gota kind of read through
it all but yes the bigger master plan is
is um I don't know who here might be the
bigger cyclist or mountain biker or
hiker or whatever but there are our
individuals that like to say come to a
town and ride all weekend or whatnot and
for us right now to get in your car and
ride to RI drive to River Mountain get
out ride that then get back in your car
and go and go to Rattlesnake or whatever
these assets are so closely you know
connected they're not physically
connected now but this would make them
connected um and then you would grow to
this uh right now there is not a full
Trail around Lake
Mel that I'm aware of the the was trail
wasw trail goes around the north side
there's the Blue Ridge Trail Blue Ridge
Mountain rattlesnake so how do we
connect all that and make it um
something special more than just unique
one-offs here and there maybe in in
uh October or November we can have
Katherine come in and maybe talk more
about it yes uh so I actually asked her
if she would be open to that she said
definitely she would yeah so um I know
that she wants to finalize this version
uh first but yes I think that would be a
great concept I mean a great idea is to
have her come and give a presentation I
know her so I can I'll reach out to her
okay that be great see when it's best
for her based on the master plan
completion and her schedule so
okay any other
questions like I said it is is a draft
so we don't want
to give it PR present it to the public
or anything if everybody will keep it to
themselves I'd appreciate that um so
just one one board item we haven't had
anything to the board um in the past so
I don't really have anything in the last
uh week or two to present on uh what it
will be on the next agenda um meeting I
will be taking a um for Two Rivers is
and this plays into this project a
little bit the two rivers trail part of
the Arkansas River so the section that's
in two rivers that is City owned um we
applied for an RTP Grant and we have had
successful bids on that and we were able
to find enough money to facilitate a I
think it's roughly $250,000 resurfacing
so we'll be resurfacing the all the
asphalt uh Trail Arkansas River Trail
out at Two Rivers which I'm really
excited about has been needed if you're
a cyclist um and so that's a nice
project that we'll be taking um then I
did Cover the master plan one other
thing I wanted to report out on was this
building here so the board no longer
meets here the City Board no longer
meets here they have actually um moved
to City Hall so if you plan to come to
another board meeting um please visit
City Hall this location I'm working with
our it Department to try to keep as much
of this it technical aspect stuff here
um there'll be more information to come
on that but we'll plan on still meeting
here unless there's something from the
commission um we've always met outside
of City Hall I think it's easier to do
that if there's a desire from youall to
meet at City Hall in the boardroom we're
it's definitely available and we can
schedule that but it's not my
recommendation uh currently and um then
there's the sales tax initiative uh
since we've met it was passed by the
board uh fully so I do appreciate the
board for their you know passing and
their support there were a few uh minor
changes to the um items that I've
presented to you thus far the one of the
biggest ones was they took $5 million
off of The Outdoor Sports Complex making
it a 55 million doll project instead of
$60 million project and I believe they
put that towards infrastructure and uh
trash trucks if I recall that correctly
um obviously there'll be a new um layout
of the exact information um and that
will be voted on now in no in November
5th at the presidential election so um
somebody did ask me how we could um how
this group could support the sales tax
initiative um I do appreciate the letter
th far um you know supporting on your
social media um as as you'd want would
be awesome there may be some volunteer
opportunities that come up in the future
for the campaign uh if you wanted to
sign up I I'll be sharing that
information information when I have it
uh the mayor's website is a great place
to send people that are uh just need
more information there's a lot of great
information there and there's an
opportunity to um for people to request
for um people to come out and speak to
this sales tax um and so if anybody ever
asks you questions and you don't feel
comfortable with all the information or
whatever I would recommend sending them
to the uh website as well as uh
contacting us for uh more information on
the sales tax so is there any questions
on the sales tax at this time I just uh
I wasn't in person but watched it online
and want to thank Sam Ellis for getting
up there and speaking on behalf of of
the parts commission and uh I don't know
if was anyone else there at the board
meeting thank you so much for for being
there and I want to say thanks as well
yeah greatly appreciated and well stated
by both of you yeah I I want to say
thank you too I thought it was it was
great there was there was some uh
individuals that were you know against
the sales tax but if you listen to what
they were saying there was a lot of
misinformed people I believe and so uh
the individuals that stood up and
supported it had some really good um
data and really good point so I
appreciate that do you know if the city
will have like a mock Ballot or what it
will look like that can be a bit
confusing and I hear it's the last item
the ballot
right I can pass that along okay I don't
know but if that's a request um I think
it'll help something to share like on
social media
I I
agree you
tricky yes sometimes yes
no right yeah I think some clarification
of How It's laid out and also
clarification of uh for part since there
were some small changes I don't know if
the information's been updated on the
mayor's site yet in terms of the little
tweaks so little amendments that happen
at the end but um but all in all it's
it's it's about what it's been the whole
time
so okay so that's kind of that's the
biggest reports I have I think somebody
might have had some questions about some
playgrounds yes can you please update on
boil Park um I did see in the minutes
that the equipment playground equipment
started in August 5th so if that started
and what the timeline is to ultimately
get to Kanas right so
we I'll just back up a little bit so we
were able to get some funding through uh
some bond funds and there was a decision
to replace three playgrounds one of them
was pinky one of them was Bole and one
of them was um Kanas uh we ended up
presenting the plans to the neighborhood
uh for I believe all of them at
different popup events uh the
neighborhood was able to select um
working with our our staff and um anyway
we have a vendor that is installing them
one by one they've completed pinky uh
we've had some challenges there with the
heat index so we're we're working on
some um changes to the to the uh opening
there but that one's finished and we're
finishing some some Landscaping there
bull park is in the middle of uh
construction it's a it's actually one of
the biggest playgrounds it's a really
almost a million-dollar playground
replacement when you add in all the
grants that we applied for and
everything else there's also a really
exciting mountain bike project that is
uh nearing completion there that we've
already heard from a lot of mountain
bike individuals that it's a really
exciting project so I look forward to
having a big um opening for that and I
understand that that might be four to
six weeks out um Justin our director of
operations is not here he can give you
more detail um but once they finish that
once the vendor finishes the actual
playground they'll be moving over to
kuis I know that the neighborhood is
excited because they see some of the
components there at kuis um but there's
only one local installer for this
company that and they go from playground
to playground so I know we all won it
today but I appreciate everybody's
patience yeah thank you thank
you all right
uh Echo
okay all right um do we have any
presentations I don't think we have any
for this month let like
uh next month we'll have Shanda speak
about the uh the summer youth program um
unfinished business I'll just kind of
quickly go through these
um I appreciate everyone supporting uh
the parts commission letter uh that was
uh emailed to uh the mayor and the City
of board of directors just showing our
support for the Sal stats and um I don't
think that's the the main reason it was
pass but um it definitely helped uh
having seeing the support from the parts
commission so appreciate everyone doing
that um on the sales tats initiative I I
do want um and maybe we can we can talk
about this um next month the new
business but I do wanted to to Leland's
point is is all right now that the now
that the board has passed C stats to be
voted on and the presidential election
in early November what what can the
commission do and um you know I've got
some ideas of you know writing a letter
to the to the to the paper editorial or
social media campaigns um and or even
doing like a popup at a few parts and
having the commission there to answer
questions so
uh I I would like you know as we get for
next month is maybe a new business you
know if you guys want to come up with
some ideas of hey what what's there out
there that's creative to help us because
I mean to me we we we do face an uphill
battle just because three years ago it
was defeated pretty much 68 to 32 and um
I think I think the city needs all the
help we can get and and I think if if we
can kind of form a a a
coalition to help to help market and
promote the sales that's because I don't
know what what the percentage of but
it's it's over what 50% that's going to
the part so um I would I would please if
you want to brainstorm and and think
about what we can do to help uh we have
three months to go and uh it could be
just as little as a social media post
but I think maybe some more creative
things or editorials for the paper that
I'd be happy to write or a pop up a few
parts so any comments from many of the
Commissioners or
staff that you can think of
now
um if not I want to save it for news
business next but anything you have
comments right now
today yeah I asked Kappy last time she
was here and this was all brought up if
anyone had from the mayor's office had
reached out to the group that it was
opposed to it last time that put a lot
of money
into making sure people didn't vote for
it um they own the athletic clubs in
town
um I don't know if it's coincidence or
not but has anyone reached out to them
got any feedback I mean is there a new
group that's already I think there is a
from what I've heard there is an anti
there's a Facebook group I think that's
that's anti- sales tats I'm not
sure um I'm not on Facebook but um there
is an anti Facebook group I've heard of
has anyone heard of
it no I just heard that today um I can I
can test my source real quick
yeah no I'm not the most plugged in on
Facebook or any of that stuff so
um I think it'd be curious though just
to at least see what the what
the messaging was last time I vaguely
remember it it's the same old tropes
dragged out and beat down on I'll I'll
say why you shouldn't want to say ta
some of the negative came last time from
some of the board directors they weren't
all they seem like they're on board now
and now they're all on board so I mean
hopefully that that is the big swing or
the change that's what I'm hoping I mean
because what two or three were against
it last time right I think so I think
most people felt it was rushed last time
so
since we went through
that I think people have had it in their
minds and had time to really
diges
microphone I'm W it's coming
through um but uh I mean
obviously some of the biggest groups
that you can get involved whether it's
the you know Little Rock Realtor
Association I mean there are people like
that um
that really are Hands-On out in the
community so there much formable support
as as we can get is important and then
Ben what did you say that result was the
last election don't quote me but I think
in 2021 the last time went was it 6832
against it was like 2/3 one3 kind of
thing or close to it in that range that
was 2021 and
then the mayor won and it did go the The
Ballot I think last year at the
tornadoes uh caus him to to do it this
year
so so yeah uh but I think as Leeland
said there's all every board directors
for it and um it's GNA have to take
people like us to help get this passed
so come with your ideas till for next
month and let's create some action items
out of net month's
meeting
just put it to you Andrea just because
you'll talk to him more than I will but
I mean is the mayor's office going to
put out some marketing and stuff that's
more to the public quicker than at the
very end or
okay okay I'm just asking because it's
like at some of the meetings stuff
hadn't been seen till right at the
meeting and the city meetings and stuff
like Community
meetings
okay
awesome britty hey guys just to uh give
you some behind the scenes perspective
on things that I'm working on things the
task for force is working on so um you
know excutive Administration did learn a
lot from the last two times and we have
a internal task force that includes uh
representation from all the Departments
that are going to be affected positively
by the tax and we meet together um we
were kind of on pause until the board
gave its thumbs up but we're going to be
meeting again um as far as Parks goes
you know I take this very seriously uh
and want every bit of that
$219 million now that will'll be going
to Parks and Recreation um and for
people to understand fully what that
means when they're voting yes for it so
um just so you know things that are
coming down the pipe from me are signs
at every facility that we'll be getting
Improvement funds so at ribs and golf
we're going to do some core Plass signs
outside of the facility so that existing
patrons to that facility can see what
the improvements would look like and
educate themselves hopefully once they
see that rendering we have a lot more
rendering and a lot more plans this time
than we did in 2021 and I hope that will
impress the community to dig a little
bit deeper and educate themselves on the
tax um what else are we doing um there
is of course the parks dedicated website
for the tax money that will be going
into Parks uh so if you search little
rock.guy you've got the brochure that
you saw a couple months ago there hasn't
been very many tweaks to that but we
have added the um Consultants
presentation to the board as it relates
to the sports
complexes um what else do we have um you
know we we definitely want to get in
front of people and tell them about the
tax from our words to hear it from us to
see the project renderings to read these
materials to ask the director and the
deputy director's questions about how
the money is going to be spent because
we want to build that trust so if you
are in a neighborhood association if you
are a professional member of an
organization like reach out to me uh or
Leland or click that button on our
website or the mayor's web page about
the tax to book us for that meeting
because we will come to you and present
so we want to tell people about this as
much as possible that's how uh we could
really use your help between now and the
next meeting
thank
you all right
um next line was commissioner
subcommittee discussion uh so if you
don't remember from last month
um uh Quinton volunteered to do social
media committee and then uh JT is going
to be master plan committee uh chair and
then Sam is Parts conservative chair and
then Linda will be on the master plan
chair or master plan committee uh so
just kind of wanted to uh go over that
what we went over in in
July if uh if you don't if you weren't
here we've uh we had three three members
I just talked about that volunteer to to
be sub committee chairs and the next
line in new business is those
subcommittees can appoint members to
their
subcommittee is everyone on
understand that did I get that right
that is correct and then once the chair
of each subcommittee appoints members to
their respective subcommittee then all
of that needs to be approved by this
commission
okay go
ahead uh so as chair of Master Plan um I
would like to appoint Linda Smith and
Mike Bernardo as members of that
committee
if it please
commission do we vote just at the end of
it or now for each committee I'm sure we
just vote at the end of it I would
suggest after each uh committee
appointment okay then we'll have a
vote okay does does anyone else
have does anyone else want to be
appointed to the master
Parts you do I I would like to uh I
would like to be a part of that if if I
don't know if I can do uh be on a
separate committee but I would like to
be part of the master plan as well if
possible more than
marrier okay
so JT has nominated Sam Canon Linda and
Mike all those in favor of voting for
these uh master plan committee members
say I I I I'll
opposed okay let's go to part
Conservancy Sam can you nominate
me I nominate
you I I'm gonna need some help on this
one so uh yes is there any other
interest for our
committee I would like to be okay summer
would you nominate summer Sam I nominate
summer I was trying to figure out who
said
that sorry I couldn't be there in person
today no worries looks like you're in a
park you
win I mean what a better place for a
park submission does anyone else have
interest in being nominated by Sam to
Park
Conservancy all right
Quinton you're up do you have You' like
to nominate anyone hopefully those
people who haven't been do we have we
need a vote for okay uh all those in
favor of the committee members for the
um Parts and Services subcommittee say I
all opposed
I uh and then okay uh we're at social
media I would hope those I know Ron's
not here Quincy's online is anyone else
that hasn't well I feel so strongly that
everyone should be on a subcommittee and
so I believe that everyone that's not
already on one can be on the social
media
subcommittee okay who is not on a
committee I I would like to be on social
media there you go uh yeah I uh I'm
sorry I am this is Quincy talking I
would like to be on the social media
subcommittee Perfect all right and then
we're gonna go ahead and just go ahead
and nominate Ron okay I'll nominate Ron
shamia and Quincy to be on the okay all
those in
favor I I
I okay thank you all everyone is on a
committee now of um mahogany if you
don't mind sending out kind of a list of
all that um just when you can before
next month that would be great so
everyone
knows um in your packet um you know
there is there is the bylaws of the
advisory commission it doesn't go into
detail
when it talks about
subcommission or committees on page six
of the page six of the
uh the bylaws it just talks about the
three committees and and how you can be
appointed by each one but if you look on
page um one and two it talks about the
responsibilities of the actual
commission a lot of that geared toward
social media and marketing
and master plan and all that
so I would I would encourage the the
chair people to to try to you know maybe
hold a meeting introduction meeting to
get started on this um I know there are
rules
around more than one more than two
people have to you know get emailed and
all that but
um okay right um can you the meetings of
a subcommittee of the Parks Commission
are considered public meetings open
public meetings and open public meetings
are subject to the Freedom of
Information Act requirements um as far
as notice to Media the the for Freedom
of Information Act speaks in terms of
special meetings in a two-hour prior
notice I would follow that rule
regarding special meetings this will not
be a special meeting of the Parks
Commission but it's a meeting of a
committee of a par commission and um
give at least the parks department give
at least 2our prior notice to the city's
PR representative Aon
Sadler regarding the meeting this
subcommittee meeting would need to be um
recorded because it is a public meeting
and the recording of a public meeting is
required by State Statute and the
recording must be maintained by uh by
the parks department for one year it's
it's the the same rules that would apply
to the L Rock Parks Comm commission
applies to the meetings of the
Committees of the L Parks Commission but
I can just record that on my phone and
get it to you guys
or well I would suggest coordinating
with the parks department and director
couch because those recordings have to
be maintained or required to be
maintained for a year through the
through the parks department I'm saying
there's nothing definitive that says how
or the method of the method of recording
no no
to should work right as long as it's
able to be maintained by the parks
department the recording has to be audio
but it can also include audio and
visual yeah so if you can't do it in
person if teams or zooms better which
probably is for a lot of people um or
you can potentially do it before and
after these meetings which could be
recorded here and that's been done
before because the there's already a
setup for recording and things of that
nature
is there a rule about
emails I mean because our emails
probably foilable when we're talking
about this type um the the idea that to
Commissioners emailing back and forth
regarding um business of the Parks
Commission that's not what you want to
do because that can be considered having
a a meeting um through email and and you
can't that's not allowed under the open
meeting laws what if we're what if we're
emailing
about setting up a
meeting I would suggest that that all go
through the parks department is
regarding setting up coordin setting up
commission meetings well excuse me
committee meetings get like copy Leland
or what does that mean that and Leland
did did you uh I believe you did that
before and coordinated with some of the
um committee
meetings coordinated those
we've done it a series of different ways
yes Beth but um I don't know what always
goes on behind closed
doors um I I would just say that the
parks offices are can be utilized for
meetings and mahogany could help set up
a meeting so if you wanted to you know
to be serious about it you could uh
email me the the time and all this and
mahogany and mahogany could send
something back out I know that's still
email
but that and that would be one
commissioner at the chair emailing the
the parks department to request the
coordination of setting up the committee
meeting so that's not considered having
a meeting outside of
the The Forum that's not considered a
public meeting at that point now two
Commissioners emailing back and forth
about Parks Commission business that
might be considered a meeting uh that
it's it's subject to open meeting laws
and you just can't have that through
email
well let me ask you this can if we had
it through we can talk about this
offline too I just I feel like some of
this stuff's ineffective to actually
getting the job done and I'm okay like
if there's a foyer request for my email
about what I've been talking about I
know that might come if I know that's
going to come then is that okay for me
to send it through
email like like I like like you're so
like let's say you get a foer request to
the city attorney's office and you're
like all right Quinton here you know
here it is um give me all your emails on
this topic um is that is that something
that we can do to just further along
this because if a fore request never
comes and it's never it's never an issue
right I I think we're not talking about
the same thing okay what what I'm
talking about is two commission members
cannot have a meeting about Parks
business through email because that is
that is outside of the regular meeting
process the media would have to be
notified you cannot have a meeting
virtually through email back and forth
that would violate open meetings laws um
okay if you're talking about your emails
being subject to Foya it possibly could
be if you're emailing to the parks
department about something related to to
the Parks Commission business it could
be considered a public record in subject
to
foia okay thank you we we cannot have
commission meetings through email is
what what this amounts to that's what
I'm talking about is the open public
meeting needs to be in in public uh the
media
notified and available for media
participation if they so choose and that
just can't happen through email back and
forth between all these Parks
Commissioners Beth can you can you put
together an email and email the
commission just just the the bullet
points of of everything just so we're
all understand as far as sure as far as
meetings and emails and I think I've
sent those out before but I'm happy to
do so cannot cond excuse me cannot
conduct meetings through email they have
to be either at a regular business
meeting or at a especially called
meeting yeah yeah I think it' be good to
have it just a visual of it and have
everyone see it
so anything else on new
business okay uh agenda items for next
meeting I think um we're going to have
Shanda give a presentation about the
summer youth program talk about the
testing that's going on with at West
Central um anything else I I will try to
get kathern Andrews here maybe in a
couple months to to talk about uh this
master plan that Leland went over
anything else that oh and then I also
want to know bring your ideas about
sales tats promotion uh I want that to
be a new business as well
so
anything yeah I'm just don't share with
the public is all as l i mean after next
week it's it's open to the public but I
mean I think some of some people might
want to take it and actually read some
aspects of it so I'd say just a standing
open item on sales tax initiative like
you you'd mentioned Laten like $5 got
pulled out of one spot and I mean just
so we have updated numbers and sort of
what the you know renderings that kind
of thing that um Britney talked about
and I mean just so we can start getting
access to that kind of information to
help
move the conversation along we do have
some we do have some renderings um and
there might be some additional ones made
in the future depending on
funding but
yes okay anything else for next
meeting all right um go
ahead uh can you put on there for new
business
uh uh pickle ball tournament oh
love to hear about
that yeah you want to share about
hmen bless
you I don't know why pickle ball um made
me think about that but um we have
started a community series meeting at
Hinman park that is focused on outdoor
recreation at that Park so if you are
able uh please join us tomorrow evening
at 5:30 at the pro shop we will be doing
a focus group on disc golf um and then 3
weeks from that day on September 5th at
5:30 we will be holding hosting a wider
community meeting we expect a lot of
people from the neighborhoods nearby to
come talk to us about what they want as
far as amenities facilities um the
design so please share that information
it's on our Facebook page it's on our
website um please share the word about
the highman park community meeting
series thank
you okay borle and feedback director
Lewis you have
anything just want to give my thanks um
especially to all of you and then West
Central for the progress that they made
over the summer I visited a few times
and that's why I was saying well I know
they got kids over there because I went
so um it was really good and then they
had a football Clinic a few weeks ago
and that was good yes um and I'm just
grateful for the progress that's being
made with Bo as well as Kanas um because
I get caught and emails all the time on
just various topics and Leland is always
um attentive in answers so timely so it
just makes it easier for me when I'm
having to relay their have you got any
feedback from your wood residents about
the sales
stats yes the majority are following my
lead well I'll say the ones that I'm
speaking with directly and that's I
think I made that statement a while ago
we have to take the leadership on this
and educate our residents if they see
how we feel um and the stance that we're
taking it influences them if I was to
walk around and negative NY and started
talking about the the cons and
everything under the sun they follow
that lead and that's not what we need so
if we can all be advocators which sounds
like we are from this meeting but that's
really the stance on it now that all of
the board which I wasn't on the board
when they didn't agree the first time
but now that all are on board this time
um um it's our opportunity to get it
right and really advocate in our Ward
through various meetings and I did get
confirmation from the mayor sitting here
um about the marketing campaigns and all
of that's going to kick off after Labor
Day so there are going to be continuing
meetings um he just left one actually uh
with the group so that's the focus now
is getting in front of our residents to
really talk about the importance of this
because I tell people all the time we
have this laundry list of needs and not
enough funds and how fair is that if we
want to keep adding projects and adding
requests but yet we don't want to come
out of pocket for anything and then Mia
I I had to text her the moment she was
speaking because she took the words out
of my mouth personally about how we can
go to other places enjoy their Sports
complexes all of their venues and the
benefits that their City have and we
don't say one thing when we look at that
receipt and it has that tax multiple
taxes we don't say a work we go to
Dallas we go to Atlanta we go to Houston
we go to fville Springdale all of that
but when it comes to where we lay our
heads we have a problem and that's my
personal problem with this city I'm
hoping that this time we can get it
right well said all right
um nothing else it's 125 amen right
there you go it's a good ending well
that's gonna
call meeting to the end I have no gavl
so done thank thank you
