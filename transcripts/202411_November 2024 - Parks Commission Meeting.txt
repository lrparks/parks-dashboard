to staff reports
uh
Leland would you just go on from
here okay good afternoon does anybody
have any questions for staff on any of
their projects or
reports okay seeing none I will move on
to what um we have either in the past
taken to the uh board for the agenda or
recently or or what our plans are for
the next um month and so um one of our
larger items which is not um it's not
any funding associated with it it's
actually a donation uh the Clifton
family has uh reached out to us and they
have uh 5 Acres of of land adjacent to
rimel Park which is uh out on 440 by the
Little Rock Port between the Little Rock
Port and the Little Rock Airport and
this property is um deemed necessary for
the functioning of the park uh it's
adjacent to our entrance and um helps
with our buffer to the interstate uh the
family has agreed to um or reached out
to us and offered to donate it to us and
we've accepted that donation and working
to take it to um the board um for final
approval if there's any questions on on
that agenda item please let me know uh
some some future ones would be the the
um senior facility so the senior
facility will actually as youall all
know will be for this facility here we
have completed construction plans and we
are putting out to bid as we speak this
week is my understanding and once that's
out to bid it'll be out to bid for
roughly 3 weeks and then assuming we
have an successful bid
we will be um taking that to the board
as soon as possible as well uh we did
take uh previously a proposal to improve
the roadway at Reservoir Park due to
tornado damages um the day before we
presented to the board there was a
letter received from the federal
government about our funding our FEMA
funding and that um oddly enough that
the road work will not be funded at this
time and we are in the process of
figuring out our appeal process and what
we will appeal and what we will not um
due to that um issue we did not take it
to the board and so we're this time at a
standstill again on Reservoir Park in
terms of the road we're moving forward
with other improvements there and we've
requested help from Public Works to help
us with the major roadway that you the
neighborhood uses for a cut through
through there to help patch and do some
minor improvements to improve that road
but the main Park uh roadway work is um
still ongoing uh for discussion another
item I I'm hopeful to be able to bring
to the board before the end of the year
we're working on an ADA transition plan
we've been working back and forth on
this a long time um I recently had
another meeting with Cromwell who was
selected to do this uh work for us as a
professional um design company and um
they are propos proposing to get us a
new uh proposal to look at um any day
now and that will include not only an
ada8 transition plan but also help us a
little bit with our inventory and asset
management because we have to have a
little bit more clearer understanding or
updated history on that information is
helpful with developing an ada8
transition plan so any discussion on any
of those
items yes
Linda um
this uh donation adjacent to Rimmel Park
uh I had understood that one of our
responsibilities and it's listed in our
bylaws uh responsibility number c is
that this uh commission would take
action on acquisition and disposition so
a donation doesn't require any action is
that Beth could you comment on
that I would have to to review the the
policy and I have not I'm not prepared
to to answer that at this point in
time um and and the only reason I bring
this up is that
um I think one of our responsibilities
is to understand the number of parks the
size of the parks that we're required to
maintain in the city and uh while I'm
all for an adjacent land I I don't want
us to skip steps that I think that the
citizens of Little Rock have tasked us
with is to make sure that as we take on
new property that we do have the funds
to maintain it so I don't disagree um
that's one reason I'll bring it up today
uh it hasn't we haven't finalized to
take it to the board however um some
steps might have been stepped over
because it is a uh donation and it's a
250,000 plus donation of land and it's
needed for the land that doesn't really
make any major difference but again
that's you know if we want to to um if
the commission here today wanted to you
know make some kind of um change to that
we could but um again that's on why
we're discussing it today so um if if
Beth can review it and we can get back
to that or but and um also I believe at
one point in time a property swap had
been presented to this
commission um several months ago is that
your recollection we did uh yes so we
presented that that was back of the uh
Clinton U Park this whole this whole
board approved um a land swap back then
so if I mean if it's needed I could give
a little bit more understanding of the
donation here and and we could you know
I could request to the board vote on it
I guess if that would be helpful
um but I'd hate to to um delay it
another month um or to um the individual
may not want to donate it at that time
so and I'm just briefly looking through
the asset management and disposition um
policy uh
without you know reviewing it in detail
right but this this um which I've
reviewed it in detail many times before
but but not recently
um this policy deals it looks like
mostly with the disposition of property
that's already owned by the city as a
park
property yeah and and L just so you know
I I agree I'm not in the situation of
trying to uh add more to our plate it's
just this actually if you look at the
aerial the roadway for the entrance of
the park
actually goes across this property and I
don't know how that was originally
developed or how any of that happened so
I guess it was a little bit of my
blindsided of just saying like oh yeah
we really do need this piece of property
if it was another piece of property that
was just random out in wherever um you
know would the discussion wouldn't even
can't come to this board to discuss so
anyway that help I I I have no action I
I I just wanted us to be aware that this
is something especially when we're
dealing with property that I think um we
should really look into but a donation
of of property that makes good sense I
I'm pleased to that you brought this to
us to hear about and I'm supportive of
it thank you thank
you and Beth
fuel well again it it looks like to me
just from looking at the the policy
that's in front of me U briefly this
this asset management and disposition
policy relates more to Parcels that the
city already owns as Parks property and
the potential disposition or disposal of
those parcels
well if you look at it in further detail
let us know next month if you have a if
I have anything else anything else yes
sir thank you do have just one or two
more notes just um since there weren't
any staff questions or there's no report
from them uh just a few things to know
before we meet next um we will be
working to install a Christmas tree on
Main Street uh just so everybody is
aware that uh the parks department um is
has the major role of the installation
of a Christmas tree at the corner of
Maine and fifth uh working with our
downtown partnership down there and our
goal is to have that up uh next week uh
if weather doesn't create a problem uh
quanis Park is an ongoing project we did
finish um boil and Pinky and had some
two great openings this last month um if
you were able to make it out to those I
appreciate it if not I understand uh we
are also continuing a major construction
project at Western Hills Park we've
discussed that many many times but we
have an ongoing construction project
there uh just to know and um we're
working on several rfps and if we are
successful at getting an RFP out one of
them currently is for the Arkansas River
Trail the goal is uh looking for um uh
opportunities for concessions or vendors
to locate on the Arkansas River
Trail um there's been some requests by
citizens to um look into this and and
had that request to do that and so we're
putting out an RFP to see if there's any
official proposals that we would receive
from the public and there's many others
that we're working on and I'll bring
those to this um commission to discuss
but just knowing that those are things
that might come out as a bid item uh
that you would see or hear about um so
that's one of some of the biggest things
um Bry do you have any events that you
wanted to note today
okay hey leand wri is going up there I
on um on a future meeting like nothing
right away but for the safety report
would it be possible to get Courtney
maybe to put together on the safety
inspections that they're doing at the
parks just like what are some of the
common findings and are there any that
are of Chief concern to you yes if you
want to add that to um I would recommend
just adding that to the agenda items for
next meeting when you when we get there
but that's noted so Perry can absolutely
do that I know he's always presenting to
us so absolutely it's a great
idea
Britney hi um so yeah uh this year we
have the first event of its kind an
endurance trail running event at allop
Park that is dubbed uh Squatch till you
drop it has a uh Bigfoot theme so that's
being put on by our new outdoor
recreation program coordinator Mike
Simmons uh we'll have roughly 50 people
signed up for that we've been pushing
that on social media um prizes include
custom socks which are super cute uh
they are still looking for a handful of
volunteers so if anyone is interested in
volunteering at that event uh there is a
5K element in the morning so a trail run
5k that does one whole loop around allop
Park trails at 8:00 in the morning and
then the 6-h hour endurance trail run
begins at 10:00 a.m. so if you want to
come and support the runners support the
outdoor recreation programmer will be at
allop Park uh close to the tennis courts
is where we'll be set up so that is this
Saturday um other than that uh this

about a month ago there was a group of
staff that participated had the
opportunity to participate in the Nation
Parks and Recreation conference in
Atlanta when we were at the conference

items and one of them was uh something
that you'll find in the bag in front of

right welcome Leon good to have you on
board
um we good with your reports or we are
obviously would like to talk a little
bit about the sales tax but um I see
that down under new business so we'll
cover it there just so everybody's
understand all right do we have a
presentation we do I invite uh Justin
dorsy to to go to the podium and give us
a quick um update on our bond expense we
covered this um last month we gave a um
update on arpa uh Justin was out sick so
I covered that but I believe many of
youall asked and said that it was very
helpful to hear this so this is another
big um um funding source that we have uh
thankfully and so Justin if you just
give us what we've been able to
accomplish okay thank you very much
we'll just briefly kind of run through
an overview and uh update um if you
click to the next one uh so we took on
uh a little over $5 million in in bond
projects over the last couple years and
uh most of these are completed or are
very nearing completion and you can kind
of see the breakout there uh of of how
those funds were allocated and a lot of
that was based uh very heavily on
community input and Community
involvement there was a a portal on the
website at times where uh neighborhood
associations could go in and actually
submit input
and that's how we kind of landed on on
several of these projects so just run
through those real quick next slide uh
the first one's boil Park uh really
heavy in the neighborhood uh to involve
that Parks uh was kind of the lead on
design of that uh worked with LSI
playgrounds to design that area um the
overall project here what's interesting
is uh that that playground alone not not
counting the mountain bikes but just the
the playground in the bond area um was
right at 750 ,000 um and we were able to
accomplish that with both um the bond
funds and then using a $250,000 outdoor
W Grant and then some additional
matching funds so we were able to
stretch those and actually come up with
a a really nice playground that's uh
being received really well and we go to
the next slide and look at some some
photos I had the grand opening there uh
just a week or two ago so um it's uh
very heavily used the next Park uh is
Pinky Park if you've not been out there
I would really encourage you to go uh
take a look at that because what was so
interesting about this project is it was
basically a complete um redesign overall
of the whole park um about the only
thing that's in the same place is the
basketball courts and those were redone
they look really nice but um we were
able to to utilize the space um there's
new playground uh new Pavilion a nice
new Green Space all new amenities and
the uh the thing that we're really proud
of there is using our in-house design
team to design that our in construction
team uh with matching and in kind doing
all the sidewalks the dirt work the tree
uh trimming cutting and tree planting um
we were able to to equate that to about
150,000 extra dollars um so we were able
to stretch that 300,000 a little bit
more come up with a really nice park for
the neighborhood there at
Panky um the next one that's uh there's
some photos of of Panky there uh the
next uh Bond uh Park project that we're
working on is Kanas it's under
construction right now and uh we have a
goal to have it finished hopefully by
the end of the year um all these
projects kind of fail just in production
really really close together which was a
challenge for us and uh just keeping our
fingers crossed that weather will
cooperate uh now that we're getting kind
of into to the the fall and winter
season with rain and stuff that we can
get that but um red the walking trail
this one we we did get some really uh
valuable Community input and that our
plans and the in-house design guys
changed um cuz one of the things that we
had really thought and had planned uh to
do heavily was redo the basketball court
area and a lot of the funding going in
there but after meeting with the the
community out at the park uh one evening
had a huge turnout uh for that uh deemed
that that was not high on the
neighborhoods list and that uh the the
walking trail and the pave Trail around
the the pond uh was so we were able to
kind of to to switch gears a little bit
and able to to divert some of that the
walking trail has been repaved and done
it's a really nice uh walking area the
other really neat thing about this
playground that uh the playground part
of this is uh if you'll go ahead and
switch to the next uh it's being
constructed now if you get to go out
there uh this working with LSI we were
able to get ahead of the game this this
new playground it's kind of being a nerd
on playgrounds uh is was brand new we
actually got wind of it about a month
before they actually officially released
it uh we had to wait till January 1st to
even do the PO so we were the first um
in our region and the first in the state
to get um this and there's a lot of
patented neat features on this uh more
Play features per square foot than any
other playground that they've done um
and so we'll be one of the first that
they're going to take pictures of and
use for other places so uh it'll be a
really neat uh experience for the kids
in the the community to play with that
um the next project we allocated uh over
$350,000 to just uh various neighborhood
parks and site amenities um and so there
on the left are the parks that benefited
the most from that that we chose that
had some needs um so alsup cheum
Interstate Murray and Richland and these
are things like new bleachers uh new
trash cans new benches new picnic tables
um new concrete pads for the picnic
tables to go on um and concrete pads
under some of the benches just to help
with some of the maintenance issues so
um that's pretty much completed we have
just a little small amount of funding in
that and that we are spending on uh
additional picnic tables and benches so
that as we're going around and um as Mr
Perry identifies safety issues and
broken concrete ones we'll have some
that we can we can replace and be ready
to go with those so uh the next Bond
project is uh the Jim daily fitness
center um again and sorry I left that
out I got sidetracked this morning it
was completed um September 25th we had
the grand opening there but uh it's a
much needed project it looks really good
there the overall project was 2.1
million even though we had only
allocated um uh 1.5 in the bond funds we
were able to secure some additional
funding to uh meet the needs of that
facility and get get what really needed
to be done working with Cromwell and
hide Co
construction uh and there is a a future
desire to come back with with additional
bond funds on the next round uh to do to
do a little uh few little things that we
were not able to accomplish with that
amount of funding uh this go around so
another uh successfully completed
project
there uh the next uh we allocated
$100,000 for uh
trails and working with craft and toll
and then we put that out to bid uh
looking at Two Rivers Park and repaving
uh that there was a lot of interest in
and need from both the safety aspect of
the the condition of that trail as well
as just the high usage um so the the bid
amount and the actual amount on that
project was um 250,000 so we were um did
not have enough bond funds allocated so
we were able to successfully get a RTP
grant for 75 plus the matching funds for
that so we were able to fund that
project and again stretch that um
stretch those dollars and that project
um has been successfully bid and we are
currently working on the contract and
issue a notice to proceed and our plan
right now there's a big event out there
on December 7th so we will be eventually
uh issuing that notice to start sometime
after the event on December 7th and that
project will be be
complete uh I believe the there's two
others uh that we were able to get some
Bond funding for um we were able to get
400,000 for some new park Fleet some
much needed equipment uh got two new
dump trucks a new mini excavator and a
new large John Deere tractor with one of
the big batwing Bush Hogs uh that was
was much needed and has been a huge help
to our maintenance and construction
Crews
uh that's all been spent and uh that
account I tried to buy a little bit more
and it's it's empty so we've we've
depleted that as much as we can and uh
really happy to have have all of that
there and the last uh section of bond
funding is there was uh 1.8 million
allocated for River Market improvements
and we are um that's kind of the last
project we are still working with some
various private consultants and trying
to develop uh a scope open needs for for
revitalization of that but it it has not
begun yet all the other projects are
either completed or uh nearing
completion very very soon so anybody has
any questions on the the bond
projects for the River Market what is
the is it for the playground area
outside or the actual River Market
structure housing itself yes sir the
structure okay is there is there a way
where we could once you guys get to some
more finalization points is there a way
where we'd see it before this point in
the process for which one for the River
Market excuse me oh yes ma'am okay yeah
it's just it's very early in those those
discussions so I just don't have a lot
of answers on that one yep thank you I
have a general
question can you give it like a high
level summary of how bonds evolve like
how do
they the City Board obviously approves
them but how do they get like proposed
and how does that work work yeah I can
tell you on this on these in particular
I mean there are other bonds that come
to light because of short-term financing
or or other decisions that the City
Board uh brings to light because of
funding request or however they fund
things but on this in on this individual
layout here um it was approved by a vote
to the citizens to extend the current
millage that is exists on um property is
my understanding now I don't I don't
know a lot about the and all of that um
so that would be another uh conversation
to get into but um Parks and Recreation
in the zoo was under parks to for the
line item receive 37.1 million I believe
in total funding and then the goal is is
that you have once you do a bond and you
get the funding you have approximately I
believe it's three years to expend the
money it's not the the story I've heard
is that there was another city somewhere
that did it and they got like $300
million right in bond funds and then
they set on that and took the in um the
interest off of that for a long period
of time and so in in order to not allow
that to happen there's a standard you
know understanding that you have to
expend the money in a period of time so
the reason that that's important the
reason that I bring that up is so that
um Parks didn't go after all the funding
at one time in one Bond allocation and
then sit on it so in our first
allocation we did just over $5 million
which is what Justin just went through
in terms of our expenditures now then
the next question would be is well how
did we decide on which project was which
and we did a bunch of public input and
for example pinky Park got a whole lot
of public input and we kept receiving
requests in fact they finally reached
out to us and said do we need to
continue to give you requests I said no
we're we're finalizing we have you know
you have the most request in for new
playground apparatus in your in your
neighborhood so that's how that came
about and and how the other ones came
about the um some of it like the fleet
component of it was just how I'm in our
next round I'm already asking for hey we
need to put in there I'd like to put in
there something for Fleet because we
don't have any money for Fleet and so
this is a great opportunity um there's a
lot of discussion to still be had about
what's on the next list but that's how
that came about um and just a Clarity on
the bond for the fleet Justin did say
two dump trucks two dump trucks were
ordered but we still have not received
them today um so don't expect any new
dump trucks driving around and our
construction guys are still waiting to
see those but that's kind of how that
layout happens um there was an ordinance
that was on the agenda um that was
presented at the board I didn't bring
that up in in my um discussion with this
board here today because I didn't bring
that to the table to the city of L board
um and I'm assuming that's City
management eoa office that's or CFO is
doing that ordinance and the ordinance
States it's a it's a discussion it's an
18 page or 14 page paper talking about
all this ordinance and I actually have a
a meeting with the city manager to
discuss some of our next role in that
and and how we you know plan to utilize
that funding um is that middle age
ongoing or does it have a finite date
it's ongoing until um then there's a I
don't know how often it has to be
revoted on but it's always knock on wood
my understanding again from just the
process was that it's always been
successful that the citizens have always
voted it in um but it's it's a different
thing completely in terms of there were
like six items in terms of what was
listed for for the bond and individuals
could vote on those six items uh my
understanding again was that it all
passed but it's completely different
than um a sales tax
initiative thank you
yeah any other questions for Justin yeah
just a and Leland may be able to answer
it so you don't have to jump up there to
the mic but um what's the outdoor wck
Grant I know that's from the state I
believe
but yeah because we receive that when
we're talking about cutting taxes at a
state level or anything like that like I
mean is it no so the outdoor recreation
Grant is a state grant that has federal
funds tied to it uh we've been
successful applying over many many years
it's a 50-50 matching Grant so in the
past it would go up to half a million
dollars so um if we ask for $ 250,000
was and we were rewarded for the full
amount then they expected us to match
that with 250 and we' get
500,000 um prior to co and all that one
of our most successful I think that we
did that I've been involved in we did
actually Four playgrounds in four
different parks with the outdoor wreck
um now because the pricing of everything
has gone through the roof and all this
that's changed also the um office of
outdoor recreation under our current uh
Governor has changed um there's not
anything um there's just new new
Staffing and new models in terms of what
the outdoor recreation Grant is and um
we applied and I presented our proposal
here or Justin and I did I guess um in
terms of what we were applying for
2024 um but we were we didn't we didn't
even make it to the table to uh give a
presentation which we typically do or
we've always have so I'm still trying to
figure out what it what is a responsive
new project and we're learning from that
so um and we don't know exactly what our
plan is for 2025 and those um the time
frame for that Grant is May application
and there's a bunch of different little
uh hurdles but um those are those are
how we fund projects and we continue to
fund projects but when we don't get them
it's it's a challenge so okay I was just
curious I knew it had been a pretty
decent portion of what we were I would
like to note too before we moved on that
um staff and Justin did a great job in
doing popups at at all of these and we
presented or they presented um different
playground options from different
playground vendors so if somebody was to
ask well how did we decide on those
colors or that model or that vendor um
we presented those options to the
neighborhood and then the neighborhood
actually voted at those popups so we
really wanted to have a very high um
involvement from from the public and so
he mentioned that about the basketball I
was surprised that they didn't want to
improve that but they really wanted to
do the trail and on on and on and all of
them have been that way so
y all right any other
questions all right going to move on to
unfinished business um I don't
I think we're going to have any
subcommittee reports but just in case do
anybody missing yeah JT uh this is
Quinton can you hear me oh yes sir good
okay I didn't know you were on great
yeah I'm sorry um yes uh the market or
the as of now the social Outreach social
media uh committee met and um Britney
was there Leland was there and then the
um Aaron Sadler from the mayor's office
was there and we had a great meeting
about um strategies uh post uh sales tax
U we got a lot of of great Direction uh
from the mayor's office and then uh
Britney and I are
working um to to have like a you know
goals for
2025 um so if anybody has any ideas on
things they'd like to see in the
marketing department please feel free to
let me know um also for some loow
hanging fruit and what we're trying to
do is get um the lck parks and Rex
social media Pages more hits so I think
we're about 400 short from the goals
that uh Brittney said earlier in the
year so if you haven't joined those we
ask you to join them tell your friends
to join them uh share content from The
Little Rock Parks and Rec Pages because
your friends might see them and say oh I
want to join those so uh we are putting
a big push um through social media I
think I think that's all and we've got a
lot of great ideas um we're just we're
just kind of waiting on uh what what the
mayor wants to do uh for the upcoming
year great great report thank you um any
questions about that we'll get to the
vote on the name change here in a
second
um next item here is new commission
ideas for 2025 I think
you
know in my opinion I think most of ideas
are going to have a lot to do with this
subcommittee so
um but if anybody has anything that they
want to discuss or bring up think about
it we can talk about it again next month
um that okay with you yeah that is great
um in terms of the new ideas for the
commission yeah unless anybody has
anything to share today
yeah well think about it we'll talk
about it again um this letters of
support
what I I believe that's just back to you
know being made a um a big effort in
getting a letter he was writing a
personal letter and the board here had a
letter um but um I don't know if that
was something Ben wanted to discuss was
that if he got got his letter to the
editorial uh in time or if it was ever
presented I don't know um well it's we
can Circle back to that when he's here
if he if he wants to cover that for now
that's correct um Mike Parks and Rec
dashboard yeah so
um you guys will just give me five
minutes I I kind of made some notes and
it's really like a dump of information
so it's going to be like drinking from a
fire hydr just bear with me on this so
parks and W dashboard was something that
I just kind of thought of as we were um
getting information and I was thinking
you know as board members what what
would be good for us to just kind of
know on the Fly what what do people kind
of ask us when they know we're on the
commission um what kind of information
should we know so I'm kind of putting
this out here it's not really a proposal
it's just to present a concept to the
Comm Mission and um and the director and
see if there's any interest in taking
this any further and maybe making a uh a
dashboard so the dashboard would align
kind of with the spirit of the uh the
bonds and the arpa presentations that
we've had the last two meetings um where
it gives us some good information and I
think you know in both of those
presentations we've probably scratched
our heads a little bit and said wow I
didn't know that or how does that work
or things that you know maybe somebody
from the outside would think that we
knew automatically and we don't um
so the dashboard would be kind of a
report kind of a you know a simple
dashboard but it would have the key
information that we need um to meet our
purpose to review consult and
advise um on City to the city on matters
of operation and maintenance to the uh
to the parks and rec department so it'
be high level right the detail would
still be and staff reports and and other
presentations this is just really just a
highlevel kind of account of of various
widgets um the information be helpful to
us like awareness of highle high project
statuses and and um kind of results as
we're going through so you know the
three questions we'd be answering with
the dashboards what information would
Commissioners like to have at a glance
one information with the director like
to for to have at a glance and what
information is practical to update you
know either monthly or quarterly Etc so
I'm going to just walk through some
components that just come off to the top
of my head of what a dashboard might
look like so a dashboard might start off
with you know here's a high level of the
parks assets here's here's the number of
ass Parks we have community centers
senior centers downtown district number
of Acres maintained number number of
miles of bike trails number of miles of
walking
trails dedicated pickle ball courts
number of tennis courts number of
basketball courts number of pro tennis
you know
facilities uh number of golf courses
those kinds of things and as you can see
a lot of that information is kind of
static once we put it together once it
wouldn't require a whole lot of uh
maintenance um planned Acquisitions like
we talked about you know it'd be good
just to have those kind of launch listed
there from a staffing perspective simply
you know what's authorized and and what
do we have filled what percentage are
you know are we sitting at with our
staffing um from
Finance uh the categories of funding you
know what what grants have been awarded
and completed maybe you know high level
of what's been applied for what do we
have in arpa funding what's available to
us what we've used what's progress as
far as projects go uh the same thing for
FEMA same thing for
bonds and then any other funding sources
like I know last meeting we mentioned
getting money back from
insurance um I know there's program fees
that get collected through our our
operations we get some site donations it
it seems like from the museum Etc just
be kind of nice to know Parks
Conservancy they make donations so a
dashboard would just kind of give us a
running you know total of where we are
not as a report card per se you know
it's not that parks and recs reporting
to the commission just information that
you think would be helpful for us to
have um at large and then the same thing
on the expenditures you know where are
we with capital expense year-to date um
where are we with operations as far as
what was planned and budgeted and and
what we're actually spending and then
from a project perspective just you know
the top three or four projects that
we've completed this year that we're
proud of I'd kind of like to know when
we have major projects that are
completed how they went you know what
did we plan for them to cost what did
they actually cost do we have like a lot
of change orders that kind of thing I
mean it just comes up in interest like
I'm you guys know I'm out at Kanis Park
a lot and so when they were doing the
Bridge Project and the basketball
project and they're seeing stuff get you
know redone and and reworked or delays
or whatever people are always curious
and asking me how that all panned out
and to be honest I don't know um so
those would be good things to know and
then Key activities events so we always
have so many activities and events and
the staff reports cover them very well
but the dashboard would just have like
the very highest things like the pro
tennis tournaments the you know the uh
marathons and and just the major things
that are going on so again this is not a
proposal for me it's just kind of a
brain dump on something I was thinking
might be useful and I'm just kind of
throwing it out to the Commissioners and
to the
director um as to whether there's any
whether you see any value in that and
whether any of that's practical to
provide Brittney do you think any so
you're basically it's like a cheat sheet
yeah
okay I'd like to would anything State
something before she okay go ahead so uh
Mike I think the idea is is excellent um
I just want to make sure and be clear
that there's a lot of De documents that
we currently complete that you went
through I was like listing off like well
all that's covered in that document all
that's covered in that document um for
example our budget book that we uh
present to the or that is part of the
balancing the budget list out all of our
um financials for the Department it also
lists out our accomplishments and our
vision and goals for the next year um so
that covers some of those we've also
just recently completed a report card um
project that we put out public that
shows a lot of um information uh we also
have our staff reports here that um
could we've asked if y'all wanted to
have them changed in any way I think our
feedback of that on that has been
minimal but you know maybe that's where
we could cover a little bit more on the
topic of um you know canis Park you
mentioned you know you said what we
haven't discussed discussed it um but
we've brought it up many of times but I
you know I think this would be
appropriate place to ask those questions
um I think there could be a um a
dashboard or like a quick glance item in
terms of some of the items that we could
you know bring here in terms of the
events or the highlights and stuff like
that um but I I would like to see if
there's a way that these reports that
we're already doing covers majority of
that and maybe if we make sure that you
can easily find access to those that
would answer majority of those questions
questions um but I'm I'm open to the I
mean maybe if you we could start with
those and you could review those and say
oh yeah now I understand what the
accomplishments were for 2023 what the
goals were for 2024 and then now with
the new budget book we can see that what
what they are um or I can present on
those um aspects at this meeting um but
I'm just saying we have a lot of that in
in different areas we also have an
assessment book that we um completed
this year uh or updated which does show
all of our inventory in regards to how
many tennis courts how many basketball
courts how many pick all all of that
that's always an
ongoing uh book to be updated and I
mentioned earlier today that I'm
utilizing hopefully uh Cromwell in our
Ada transition plan to help update that
and um get that even to the next level
of professionalism but um those are my
initial comments before um anybody else
was to to speak so so my question for
you is would would you find it
beneficial to
have whether it's a one-page document or
or whatever it
is whatever you want to call it would it
be beneficial to have something like
that that summarized all these
separate you know hit hit the highlights
from all these separate documents in one
place seems to me like that might be
beneficial for social media to
be able to push out
but a few thoughts um for one I would
say Mike the idea of that Hub
um Public Works has done this really
well uh they have in-house GIS so that
is one of the first things that comes to
mind and I've had that discussion in the
city's internal data team that meets we
have a data governance team that meets
and um I've spoken with the guy at
public works that's created something
called the um capital projects dashboard
for public works so I uh have brought
this idea to Leland as well of having
these bigger ticket items these arpa
projects these Bond projects these
Capital expenditures and major projects
be captured in a GIS format on a map
that is a little more intuitive to
navigate than pages of text information
so with that you would see um you would
open a GIS map with you know bullets
that you could click on and then you
would see you know maybe there are four
statuses that we change monthly or
quarterly between um design bid
construction complete and you could
track the progress of the bond project
at Panky Park on that map so um my
immediate reaction to that really
highlevel project could be implemented
with GIS we also developed an arcgis
story Maps which is something um that I
think we uh want to take another look at
tweaking and because that's just a
really good digestible way to absorb
information and navigate information
where the city's website is a little
more convoluted so um I am taking some
steps to help with data coordination now
in the department so so um I I
appreciate all of your recommendations
and I do see maybe as that one pager
piece maybe it's less
of a one-pager for the public but more
of a internal and commission facing
document that links you to all of this
information where it currently exists so
you know the data hub for the city uh
where you can find the budget book and
it snaps to page you know 103 for Parks
and Recreation or that lives on our
website here I know all of that but as
you onboard new Commissioners or want to
just familiarize yourself with the
master plan and all of these assets that
we do uh deal with internally maybe just
having a one pager that links you to
that information when you need
it
okay you okay yeah literally I'm just
throwing it out there sure sure I I love
the gis idea because I mean
for
me seeing I I think of everything on a
map that's just because of what I do so
that would be really cool I think to be
able to click in and see oh this is
where this park is because most people
don't even know where half our parks are
um so anyway great idea let me add to
that so under Little Rock City of Little
Rock Planning uh they have an intern
interactive GIS that that actually maps
all this stuff and one of them that I
use constantly is the maps for parks and
like say where are they located within
the a ward right um because I I have a
hard time keeping up the ward boundaries
right I mean somebody might say well to
you is the director doesn't know where
the parks are it's it's not that it's
just how they uh relate to other items
um what might be helpful and and this
would be public information so
I don't know if it has to be um just for
the Commissioners but is actually have a
a an area on our website Brittney that
list you know the budget report the
budget book the report card you
mentioned this but I mean like a clear
area with a small description of what
that is and why it's important and then
links to like the gis for for part so
instead of people us having to say go to
planning and look for this you'd
actually say on our website under this
area that says
whatever there's actually a link there
that takes you to that um and then you
could you know the budget book referring
to certain things in terms of
accomplishments or something it would
actually could highlight this is a
location where you can find the
accomplishments or the the vision or the
plans for the projects for the next year
blah blah blah um and then
um the assessment book that we have
currently we can highlight it there and
then our our future ones as well all of
our Master plans anyway I think there's
some clarity that we could bring up to
that
yeah okay Mike your thoughts on is that
would that be helpful yeah I mean I
haven't heard from any of the other
Commissioners I mean value or no I
already have that in my notes and don't
need that or why do I even want to know
that whatever any thoughts from anybody
else or the the interactive map that's
on the website has actually been pretty
I know it doesn't have everything I
think that you're you're requesting or
what we're talking about but um it's
been it's been my personal cheat sheet
uh when I get asked about different
parks and um maybe a park I haven't been
to in a while and remembering exactly
where it is also it does a good job of
telling you um the bike trails uh the
restrooms you know a lot of information
about that Park so it's definitely been
one that I played with a lot it's been
very helpful but I don't know if it has
everything that you're talking about
if you haven't been to it go to it
you'll spend hours on it it's like Sim
City but for
Parks I have uh looked at the budget
books in depth over the years and and I
understand what's in them so I know
where to kind of go look for them but
when you try to find something on the
city's website it's often difficult and
you go down you spend a lot of time
looking for something you know is there
and so I think my what you're pointing
out is is better links and I think
Britney that's exactly what she's
working on is we know it's there Leland
knows it's there uh we we just maybe
struggle to find some of this but I do
think I I made notes um as you were
talking about the the idea of a
dashboard and I think that uh having
those pieces of information available to
us um maybe in in in the type list with
links to where those documents are would
be very helpful as a starting point
because we know they're out there we
sometimes can't find them which brings
up uh kind of a followup I know this is
the budget time of the year so is the
parks part of the budget book
already
prepared I can speak to that so um no
it's not I mean parts of it are yes
we've
already completed what we've
accomplished and I've turned that in
it's a working document will not be
completed until the board passes the
budget but um and the reason I say that
is because I made a presentation to the
uh city manager and eoa office Mayor uh
some time ago uh and I was asked by the
CFO to present on five items um that's
that's a new request and that's why I
bring importance to that because I a lot
of people even the mayor asked me in one
of the presentations well what what
about that challenging you have over
there he knew something that I was
fighting and I said well that's not that
doesn't that's not higher than these
other five um just to know and in
previous budgets I've asked one of my
first ones I did in 22 I guess I asked
for over like $3 million worth of new
items so this year was quite a bit
different um some of the things that I
highlighted in my budget were um this
facility the senior um facility uh we
need St Staffing to manage the senior
facility and then I requested um resond
Golf Course funding for uh different
components there for improvements one of
the major ones is whole 13 which is
falling in the Arkansas River which I've
discussed here as well um so those were
the the budget items um I just gave that
presentation Friday um and so it's
relevant for me to present here I was
holding a lot of my funding and budget
talks and all that until we got to the
sales tax because there's been a lot of
discussion around that and questions um
but um you know obviously that's where
we stand now in terms of the budget um
it was not discussed in any length in
the last agenda meeting last night um
but there was a request from the CFO to
give some kind of um presentation or
summary of what all the requests were or
however all that works to the board and
and typical
historical uh fashion that I've been a
part of this they typically use the next
handful of board meetings the agenda and
the board meeting to um discuss it and
finalize it before the end of the year
before the end of the year we would
expect to see some action by the city
council that would approve the budget
and then we would have access to like
this is my I have little notes and tabs
with every page that I like to look at
about Parks uh that would be available
we think in December so the actual
budget book would not be finished until
I don't I don't know if it's I don't
know that's not the CFO finishes that I
what when when historically first
quarter sometime um okay so I mean into
next year before we see that kind of in
the January meeting for pars for this
commission I could definitely report out
on what the budget was unless they for
whatever reason didn't pass it okay but
um I'm I know that there is a lot of
request um I think there's over 40
something million dollars worth of
request out there from the Department
directors and I think the CFO said
something to
the to the fact that there's only like a
couple million dollars if that of actual
overage um and that was only for sales
tax revenue and there's other ways that
they can do it
or that's that's above me yeah
commenting on the the budget number than
the timing of the budget
yep all right anything else on
this all right speeding this up all
right we're going to entertain a motion
uh to change the name of the social
media subcommittee Mr chair actually
this would be to amend the bylaws of the
Parks
Commission um to change the name uh from
Outreach social media to marketing for
that committee okay would someone like
to make that
motion I move would modify the bylaws of
the Lorac Parks and Recreation
Commission uh to change the social
committee subcommittee name to the
marketing subcommittee to marketing
yes second all right we've got a motion
in a second any
discussion all in favor say I I any
oppos all right Mr chair I will have the
revised bylaws at the next meeting for
signature for the chair and then test
for the SEC secretary which is actually
the director of the parks department
thank you all right new business um bond
fund discussion do you have any more on
bonds I do not we've we've covered um
obviously Justin covered it but then I
covered it um with some of the questions
unless anybody has a question about
future Bond let's move on to sales tax
do you have any comments yeah I was just
obvious going to make the obvious
comment you know obviously it failed um
I have um
you know discussed it with in within
different staff meetings to say you know
this doesn't change anything and I
wanted to share that here you know it
doesn't change anything that I'm aware
of at this time in regards to our
current budget and so we're we'll
continue to proceed on with how we've
been able to accomplish what we've been
AC been able to accomplish um I'm
disappointed and sad you know that it
didn't pass um obviously there's going
to be um some things that change some of
those bigger things that the public
might see someday is that the fact that
we haven't had Capital funding now since
2021 uh when the sales tax the previous
sales tax fell off so we've been pushing
things down the road in terms of let's
let's just give one example so that the
public understands is that so like light
poles at a certain Park um are from an X
period and are considered that they need
to be updated or and um either renovated
replaced
or removed um and typically we always
wait till we have some kind of capital
funding and we can make that assessment
and update those items it is starting to
become clear that there are certain
items that we may have to consider
removing without replacing and I'm
regretful to have to say that but there
are certain items as they are deemed um
irreplaceable in terms of Maintenance
I.E like the light fixture is from 1960
and just not parts for it anymore um it
has been deemed better to remove it um
and so that's just one example we have
hundreds of thousands of different
assets that we manage those are just
small things to discuss and and items
that might um change based on other
funding um we do apply for a lot of
Grants I'm hopeful that we get more
grant funding we we're going to have to
start working a lot harder on um private
Partnerships and sponsorship uh
opportunities
uh those are different things we'll look
at for uh future funding we do have um
another Bond realm coming up which will
help us um greatly but again we've asked
for this additional Revenue um and we
didn't receive it and so there's going
to be some challenges there was a
definitely need for that uh funding so I
don't know what the uh mayor's and the
city board's plans are um and uh I look
forward to seeing what is discussed next
year and I'm assuming in the city um
State of the Union or the city address
um that the mayor will have in the
spring of next year we'll we'll know
more about goals and plans for 2025 and
um stay
tuned any questions on
that
nope um Parks
newsletter we want to talk about that or
do you want BR do you want to update us
or
you I have a suggestion we I think
Britney at the last uh meeting ask us to
think about three things that had come
up I thought today's presentation on the
bond um performance and the projects
that have been completed and our our
nearing completion was very good and if
there was an article or a summary
somehow maybe your first page that had
the just the project and the and the
amount um would be a great news article
I think the positive success of how we
have spent um bond funds in a a very uh
reasonable manner uh and how far we've
stretched that funding through the good
work of In-House design and performance
is has been really good I think that's a
good story to
tell to I think the Optics on that um
and I'd be happy to help or whatever but
there
's uh when you say in-house design I
don't think people grasp how expensive
hiring an architect to do some of this
stuff is um but I mean you guys know it
even better than I do but they're not
cheap and so when you guys have uh
in-house folks looking at it working on
it and even if it's getting it to the
point we an architect or an engineer
then checks it or you know does final
details
um I I I think that report
um I think it it's hiding how much work
you guys are
doing to stretch the 5
million there was wck grants there was
in-house stuff you guys did and I know
part of it is job description and what
you're doing but part of it is you
didn't have money to go get an architect
to do some of the stuff so you had to do
it and some of it is you got the project
further along because you all were able
with the expertise you have in house and
developed over the years to get those
things done um because I mean if I was
looking at it right I'm guessing it's I
wouldn't say it's double but I mean it
was more than $5 million invested in
these Parks right and so that should be
part of the story of what's getting sent
out to people
is the city through the bond committed 5
million but there was you know an what
was the ancillary money that went into
it as
well thanks scan and I think that's a
great addition and one of one of the
last things and it's it's something I've
I've asked um to you all individually in
the past before uh not in the meeting
but the and maybe a long time ago in the
meeting but the the multiplier
effect um so when you spend money at Jim
daily fitness center like what's the
economic impact that kind of number I
think that's helpful for people to see
and I don't know how doable it is I've
talked um when you guys have been
looking at
the marathon in the past you know what's
the economic impact that one's pretty
easy because tons of different people in
the city and parks and visitor board are
working on that as well but um I think
that's one of the things to also look at
for parks and W is what is the impact
beyond what we're spending what what is
the city benefiting in the community
all right anything else agenda items for
next meeting uh other than the one
security update that was asked about
we'll do that anything else I have one
um the master planning is uh committee
is going to meet after this that's right
so we'll have an update and I'd like to
put a little bit of time so that we can
discuss fully uh just I know we always
have a report time but maybe allow a
little bit more more which brings me
back to the new commission ideas for
2025 now that I've had a moment or two
to
reflect um it seems like we're always
rushing to get through one hour is worth
of business and I know there's other
commissions that regularly allow an hour
and a half or an hour and 15 minutes and
I'd just like us to consider that I I
don't think we have to commit to that
today but it seems like if we just had
just a little bit more time we could
really um have more discussions um and
and have more of these really helpful
reports from
staff fair enough and I'd like to just
add the for new agenda items just if the
commission wants to approve this um I
heard today uh there was a safety report
that was requested for Perry um there is
I would add in their budget so that I
can report out on the budget on anything
that happens over the next month and um
I would also think it'd be a Greatful
great idea to have a dashboard update on
what Britney and staff can help I mean
where we where we stand on updating some
links and and what we have built out if
if how far we can get on that um and I
know um Andrea wasn't able to make it
she said she had a car breakdown or
something like that um I have not heard
from Cappy but just I know that they're
weren't able to make it today so um
that's that's all I have all right
anything else for agenda for next
meeting now where where are we going to
meet for the master
plan you can it'll be around a corner in
another in the computer room okay okay
okay um so that'll be right after
this um other than that thanks for being
here we're adjourned
oh good so
