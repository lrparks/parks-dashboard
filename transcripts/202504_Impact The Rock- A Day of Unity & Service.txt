Good morning everyone. I'm BJ Wrick and
I am uh city director for Ward 7 which
is way southwest of here but I'm also
your vice mayor. I was elected by the
board of directors to be vice mayor.
Such an honor for me to be here today to
open up the ceremony. I want to thank
Leland Couch and Karen Sykes for pulling
all all this together. And I also want
to recognize my friend and cohort in
crime Kathy Peek who is here. who
represents Ward seven which ward four
which is where we are today. Thank you
all for being here. Uh April is glob
global volunteer month making a great
opportunity for us to share our
appreciation with Little Rock residents
who give of their time and energy to
make our city a better place to live,
work, and play. Every year we set aside
a day for residents to make a positive
impact on our city. Whether it's
planting flowers, which I love to do,
and trees, cleaning up parks, picking up
litter, or snuggling our furry friends,
which I'll do a little bit later in Ward
7 at the animal village. We're here to
have helping hands in every ward. This
is our chance to make a real impact
where we live, meet new people, and show
real pride in our beautiful city.
This annual event brings our community
together to make a difference with
service projects in all seven wards of
Little Rock. Whether you're passionate
about beautifying parks, helping
neighbors, or building connections, you
are to make an impact. Today is our
annual impact the rock day of unity and
service. So what does impact
mean? Impact is a sudden and powerful
effect. So, let's talk about the
powerful effect that has happened for
the past two years with Impact the
Rock. In April of 2023, over 500
volunteers went into hard-hit areas of
Little Rock to assist with the tornado
cleanup. Reservoir Park. This very park
was significantly damaged by the March
31st tornado. Volunteers have worked
hard the last two years to help clean up
Reservoir Park as well as Rock Creek
Trail. Earlier this earlier this month,
thousands of new trees have been
planted. In 2024, volunteers tallied
more than 38,000 hours of service to
Little Rock in a variety of ways from
working at Little Rock Animal Village to
cleaning up storm debris. Our volunteers
are our superstars in our city. Today,
volunteers will fan across the city
starting at 9:00 a.m. to work in all
seven wards and then be back here at
11:30 here at Reservoir Park for lunch.
There are a number of locations that
will be covered today. One of them is
Ward One, uh, litter pickup will be done
in coordination with Downtown Little
Rock Partnership. Ward two is Benny
Craig Park where they're going to work
on the Fush Creek along with the Central
Arkansas Master Naturalist. Understand
there's canoes involved in that trip. So
that should be fun. Also, W three, the
Little Rock Zoo. And then Ward four
right here, plant trees or help with
mulching or other needed work. Ward five
is clean up Rock Creek. Ward six is pick
up litter from Kanes Road. And w seven
is help with animals at the Little Rock
Animal Village. I might adopt a little
kitty today. I'm not sure.
[Laughter]
I've been thinking about it. Okay, so
next is uh I want to introduce Director
Peek. She's a big advocate for Reservoir
Park. She talks about it in her sleep, I
think. Um she wants this park to be
brought back to where it was before the
tornado. So Kathy, you want to come
forward?
Thanks, BJ. Thank you all. I will be
brief so we can get to work. Uh, thank
you for being here. It's still surreal
every time I drive through, but it looks
so much better than it did two years
ago. And in large part, that's in thanks
to to Leland Couch, our parks director,
and his crew. Uh, I never really
realized that we're kind of in a bowl
and it's sort of hard to get your
bearings because we don't have those we
don't have the playground or we it it's
just it's just interesting. But we've
done we have done a lot of war work. Uh
these uh courts will be resurfaced after
today. We have new lights. Uh there are
you probably saw trees waiting to be
planted uh up there. I don't think we're
going to ask you all to do that task.
Leland says it's like concrete. Right.
Right. Leland. You probably saw the
reservoir. They have done a lot of
remediation there. It's beautiful now.
There was a controlled burn here a few
weeks ago. Excuse me. And we've got some
really great plans. I want to mention
just a couple of other things real
quickly. Can you read my shirt? Pick it
up. It says, "Keep me here." "Keep me
here." So, we launched this uh Pick It
Up Little uh Pick It Up Little Rock
campaign about a year ago. Uh you'll
you'll see us uh working all over the
city. We would love for you to get
involved. You can get more information
if you'll go to the little rock.gov
website. It's under the public works
domain. Uh also, Adopt a Street. We are
working hard on getting uh people to
adopt a street or a park or a flower bed
or a trail or a state highway uh to make
a difference because even though I'm
sure every one of you is not a litterer,
you know, a lot of them and it just
makes me mad when I see just trash
everywhere. So, it's going to take a
village. Uh the last thing I want to
mention is an upcoming event. We have
some flyers on the table. It's a
fundraiser for this park. You know, this
is one of the biggest uh kind of Midtown
parks. You might think this is West
Little Rock and it was maybe 50 years
ago, but technically Midtown starts at
4:30 in Canrol. So, we are we are in
Midtown and it's not just you. Leewood
residents are here. People from
Foxcraftoft and Riveridge, Robinwood,
Echo Valley, all over the city love this
park. Uh when Leland had a listening
session about a year ago about what you
want to see in this park, uh the
playground was Am I stepping on your
turf? Go ahead. I I I'm gonna let I'm
gonna let Leland talk about that. So,
back to this event. Uh it is uh at
Trio's restaurant, which is right over
there. We also got hit by the tornado
and it's almost complete the
construction two years and three weeks
later. Uh and uh we are going to be
raising funds to continue to do work
here. We um the city board passed uh a
$900,000
playground playground. We need a little
bit more money for that. Uh during this
listening session, another really
important thing that people want to see
brought back is the disc golf course. So
this fundraiser is going to primarily go
to the playground and the disc golf
course. We've set a lofty goal of
$25,000.
I'm have some leftover campaign money.
I'm doning donating
$2,500 and then my restaurant's donating
the food and bar. So come on the 21st.
You can walk to Trios from here. It's
from 5 to 7. We'll feed you if you make
a donation. That's about it. And that's
all I have. Thank you for being here.
Get a flyer. And thank you so much for
your volunteerism and caring about
Reservoir.
Oh, Leland Couch.
Okay. Good morning. Thank you Kathy um
for the introduction and she said most
of my speech actually. I didn't know you
didn't tell me where. But I would like
to say and or ask really who here has
never been here to Reservoir Park. Wow.
So quite a few. So So you don't know
really what it looked like prior to the
tornado that happened two years ago. So
what's crazy is this was a very wooded,
dense, vegetated site. Um we have gone
through a major change, major uh
disaster here. Uh but we are slowly
starting to rebuild thank to people
thanks to people like yourself. Um our
parks team, we couldn't do them without
all of our uh great staff. Um but your
volunteer efforts here are what will um
today and tomorrow will help us bring
this part back. Um, I wanted to go
through just a little bit of brief
history of of the tornado here and
what's happened just so that you can
share that with other residents of
Little Rock and so that you can
understand uh how impactful this uh site
has been. So, this park lost um a major
ball field, a major playground that was
brand new, basically a restroom, uh the
pavilion up on the hill, and this tennis
court uh facility here. and then all the
road work infrastructure and all the
electrical um infrastructure throughout
the park. Uh not to mention thousands of
trees. So the park is roughly
uh 60 acres. I would say that it was uh
impacted about 50 acres of that 60. It's
pretty amazing how the tornado came
through from Reservoir Road and came and
turned and went right through the whole
park because the park is actually
L-shaped. Um this is a this is a
reservoir here for CAW. Um that is not
um city operated or parks operated, but
we have worked with them uh throughout
the process. All new fencing, their
control burn that they might have just
that they just had uh if you were aware
of um some burning maybe just the other
week. Um but moving forward, we have we
uh have replaced the uh pavilion or
renovated it. We've renovated everything
here. Here you can see the new lights,
new fencing for the tennis court. And
we'll be resurfacing the tennis court.
Uh next is the playground, ball field,
and restroom all to be um completed this
year. And so today, let's get busy and
plant all these great trees that are
down here that our uh great volunteer
coordinator Karen Sykes has provided. Uh
if you have any questions about kind of
through the process, what I've talked
about, there's a lot of information over
here on the uh fence. That's the master
plan that the community um approved
about a year ago. Uh some bo before and
after pictures and a little bit of a
timeline of what has uh occurred here.
Um I wish we could have done this
faster, but there's been a lot of
processes with FEMA and insurance and
engineers and all kinds of good stuff to
make sure we're doing the right thing.
So again, thank you for your support
today and um I want to introduce Karen
Sykes who will give you all the
information on how to get started today.
Thank you again. Thanks.
Good morning.
How is everyone today?
Thank you for showing up and being being
a parks hero. I also want to thank the
people behind me for their support as
well as park staff for helping this get
set up.
Um, today is impact the rock. This is
our day of beautifification. And like
you've heard, there are projects all
over uh the city today and all in every
every ward. So today though, we are
planting trees, right? So thank you
again for coming out. I appreciate you.
