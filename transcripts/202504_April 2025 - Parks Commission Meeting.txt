Okay, excuse me. Um, next item agenda is
a citizen community. You got to do the
all in favor. Oh, that's right. Uh, all
in favor of the approval of March
meeting minutes. Say I. I. I. All
opposed. March meeting minutes have been
approved. Okay. And the next agenda item
is citizen communication. Do we have any
citizens here that would like to say
anything? I don't see
any.
Okay. Um, next item agenda is staff
reports, director's reports, events. Um,
as they always do every month, they have
the uh staff reports have presented or
sent in their their reports. Um, hope
you guys got a chance to read him before
then, but I'll just hand it over to
Leland and he can uh if there are any
questions maybe after his report um we
can he can pose any questions about the
staff reports after he presents
question uh during roll call. I missed a
couple of people. Um, city director
Cathy Peek here. City Director Andrea
Lewis and City Attorney Simone Black
present. Thank you. Thank you for
missing me and then acknowledging me
anytime. And we also have city director
BJ Wack here. So, thank you for being
here. Vice Mayor, Vice Mayor, sorry.
Okay. So, were there any staff report
questions from from the board? I I had
just one comment, I guess, on the
operations report is um you know, we
list golf, tennis, etc., etc. I would
like to see us um list pickle ball or at
least I want to just remind everybody,
you know, it's not just the fact that I
play pickle ball and that I have that
interest, but as a commission, we need
to be aware of pickle ball's growth,
right? It's the fourth year in a row
that um pickle ball has been the fastest
growing sport in America. It's also the
third most popular now, just between
behind running and cycling. So obviously
it needs to be something we prioritize.
Um but more important or along those
lines I think not sure you know what the
uh I know Joe's coming on board here. I
don't know what our plans are
recreationally but pickle ball offers a
huge opportunity
um not just to provide more activities
for our residents but it's also one that
we can raise some revenue on. So, if we
have pickle ball lines in the community
centers, which I know we do, um you can
set up, you know, training sessions to
teach people pickle ball. You can set up
leagues. You can set up little mini
tournaments. They could even have, you
know, a traveling league between
community centers. And of course, it's
all age groups. So, it could be run
from, you know, 10 year olds on up to,
you know, whatever 70 or 80. I mean, you
can just have all kinds of different
divisions. Um, and and along those
lines, as an update, out of Kanis Park,
we just started our spring league. We've
got 48 participants. So, you know, it's
popular. There's a lot of interest out
there. I would like to see maybe um our
programs start to include pickle ball as
as something that you guys might be able
to do to to raise funds and involve the
community.
Uh Mike, that's great. I I would suggest
that it's added to recreations report
for programming in future, whereas
operations would be only reporting on it
if there was something to report from a
operations standpoint and recreation
could do something ongoing and there
would be some additional conversations
about programming and how to add more to
that. So, I appreciate that that
idea. Any other questions or comments
from the board for staff reports?
I I think I heard Mike is moving still
in the city, but he's not going to be
running the uh marathon for us anymore.
Is that
correct? So, since you brought that up,
yes. Um Mike Gity, who is the assistant
assistant director of the marathon,
sorry. Um Geneva Lamb is our director of
the marathon. Um, Mike has been a great
asset to the parks department for other
reasons as well and the marathon. Um, it
is it is um I don't think it's finalized
or formal yet. Um, but um since that's
been brought up to just to discuss it,
there is consideration of him moving to
other locations within the city. So,
um, if there no other questions or
comments, I'll go through my, um, list
of, uh, board agenda. Um, since we've
last, um, were
meeting, we did successfully take a
reservoir playground that operations has
been working on. Um, it's a $800,
$900,000 playground for Reservoir Park,
which we're really excited about. And um
that has been completed and approved by
the board. Uh this previous week or I
mean sorry last Tuesday night was um
a design proposal for Cromwell for
Reservoir Park to complete construction
drawings for Reservoir Park. Uh there
were also a lot of equipment on there
for golf. um a lift, a new lift that
we're really excited about for urban
forestry to replace their existing
bucket lift. Um and so we're moving
through some of our bond funds to be
able to acquire some of these new
equipments uh and working with our fleet
department to acquire those um and
moving forward with Reservoir Park on
some some great um new designs and and
playgrounds. So, um, a few events that
I'd like to talk about, there's two that
I and ask Karen to come up and speak
about, but outside of that, there is a
fundraiser event flyer um, next year um,
seat there. And, um, Cathy may want to
speak more to that. But on May 21st, as
you can see, is save the day for a
fundraiser event for Reservoir Park. Uh,
really excited to work with um, our park
conservancy, this uh, board as well. um
and our staff in terms of how to how to
operate a fundraiser event for Reservoir
Park. And um I want to say thank you to
uh Cappy for offering her uh restaurant
and um all the great things and I'm sure
she'll share some more, but that's on
May 21st. Also on April 29th, we'll have
a ribbon cutting for Quanis uh Park,
which is one of our last uh bond
improvement projects that we um have
been working on to complete um from the
first series of bond funds that we
received. So, uh Karen, if you'd speak
about your two events. These are two
great volunteer events. One of them is
happening this weekend. So,
good afternoon everyone.
So, as you know, volunteerism is a great
way to engage the community. It's a
great way to meet new people, make new
friends, and even boost your resume. And
in parks and recreation, we have several
opportunities for people to plug in. So
this weekend we rescheduled the LR
Strong Relief Rock Creek Trail event to
Saturday, April 12th, 9:00 a.m. at Rock
Creek Trail, which is behind Comet
Cleaners. Comet Cleaners is located at
200 North Bowman. We will have lunch. Um
the mayor will be there to kick things
off for us. Uh we have a few speakers
and then we will be planting thousands
and thousands of oak
saplings. So we definitely have
something for you to do and I hope y'all
can join us commissioners. Um we could
even set you up in a little spot and
make this the commissioner's tree
planting area. So we please come and
join us. Um we need people to bring
shovels, gloves. We'll have water there.
So bring a water bottle and then lunch
will be served at 11:30 and we'll be
there till about 3 so you can show up
when you can and stay as long as you
can. Then we also have of course quick
question. Is this from the cleanup from
the tornado from two years ago? The Rock
Creek planting the trees. Okay. I'm
sorry. Say that again.
Is I was just seeing if this is the
cleanup from the tornado two years ago
on Rock Creek. Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
Absolutely. This is our first tree
planting event since then. Um, but it's
our second post tornado event when we
opened it up back at the end of
September for National Public Lands
Day. And then we also have April 26th is
when we have impact the rock, a day
unity and service. And that is the
city's day of service and
beautifification projects. We have a
project in every single ward as well as
people can create their own and then we
ask our adopters to work in their
adopted area that day. Uh this is the
time of year when our flower bed
adopters plant all their flowers and get
that going on. So you'll you'll see the
nice little shots of color in our flower
beds. Uh for the parks part of course we
have Vinnie Craig Fush Creek. We'll be
cleaning out the trash boom there and we
will be um having the kickoff in ward 4
with again planting some trees and this
is our first post tornado event since
that uh 2023 tornado.
Um lunch will also be served.
Um Vice Mayor Wrick is kicking us off
that day. We appreciate you and I'm sure
Kathy will be there as well speaking.
Um, and let's see, lunch at 11:30 and
then our other spot is back to Rock
Creek Trail again where we will be
planting some more trees as well. So, we
hope y'all can join us there. Um, again,
we can plant a commissioner tree if
y'all would like. So, just let me know.
And then also, I just like to talk about
our volunteer opportunities in general.
I think that y'all would make great
cheerleaders uh for our volunteer
programs. We have several, in fact, we
have the most throughout the host city
and the most number of volunteer hours
and people. So, we have our of course
our stuff in our recreation side like
golf, uh coaching at our community
centers, gym daily fitness center as
well. We also have our LR pushy plants
program where we're we're mapping and
getting rid of invasive species in our
parks. And then of course we have our
adoption programs. We have adopt a park,
adopt a trail, and adopt a flower bed
that anybody can join. You'll see I have
everything listed in the report that I
turned in as well as how to sign up
which is at little rock.gov volunteer.
You will see everything there. Um, as
well, if you have any direct questions,
anybody can always call me, but if
you're wanting to volunteer at at a
facility, it really is best to call that
facility directly. And if you want to
volunteer with Marathon, of course, it's
always best to get a hold of them
directly. Any questions?
What time does it start at Reservoir
Park? 9:00 a.m. Impath the Rock. 9:00
a.m. Okay.
Quick question for you. Um, I have a
student in the school district, Little
Rock School District, that by the time
he graduates falls under the new rule
about the 75 hours. Are you guys
registered to
uh you all being parks and wreck uh
registered with the school district or
the state or however that needs to work
so that kids can high school kids can
volunteer and get their hours counted
towards that or how does that have you
looked into that or any I have and I
actually called them right before spring
break and so I have not heard back but I
plan on calling them tomorrow to follow
up to get us on that list if we're not
already and Yes, we will. Absolutely. I
I I can sign off on anything that I need
to do. Okay. I just didn't also want to
put all the burden on you. I just didn't
know what the the process was. Like my
son's going to be doing uh working with
Chip for the pro tournament. Right. And
that's volunteer hours that they're
getting for that. So, Right. Right.
Okay. All right. Any more questions?
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, thank you Karen. I'd like to now
bring up uh Shawanda Craig to introduce
some great new employee um uh that we've
been grateful to be able to add to our
um our staff or our parks team and let
them have a second to um tell a little
bit about themselves as well.
Good afternoon. I'm so excited that I
have some key staff um available now to
me and to the citizens of Little Rock to
help create programs, activities, and
events. Um so I would like to introduce
uh
Xavier on up Xavier Pal and Joe
Guzman and I'll let them introduce
themselves.
Hello to everyone. Uh my name is Xavier
Pal and uh I'm glad to be here. I've
been working in the golf business for 33
years and I'm just looking forward to
working for the Little Rock Park and
Recreation.
Welcome. Thank you.
Uh good afternoon. Joe Guzman. Just
moved here this week from Texas. Um,
want to thank everybody for your
generosity and hospitality and I'm
excited to be working parks and wreck
for over a decade now. So, thank you
very much.
Thank you. Where in Texas did you live?
Um, from Austin, but I just recently
left Corpus Christie.
Thank you. Great to have you. Thank you.
Yeah. So, I appreciate that. I think
that concludes our director's report,
staff reports, unless there's any final
questions. Thank you.
I want to acknowledge that uh
Commissioner Woods is present. So, thank
you for that. Thank you for being here.
I think that that's up to seven
commissioners. Do we have not? We have
eight now. Is that correct, Simone? Or
I'm sorry, I put you on the spot, but I
would double check with Mahogany, but oh
gosh. Um, I think it's seven. We have
eight because JT is not here. There's
seven present.
Let me check my list real quick. I'm
sorry. Yeah, I think it's I think it's
eight total.
Okay. Thank Thank you.
Okay.
Okay. Uh, thank you for the uh great
great for you guys to be here. Look
forward to working with you all. Um, our
next agenda item is presentations. I
don't think we have any presentation
scheduled for for today but
uh you know be thinking
uh for number nine for any agenda items
next month next month if we have any
ideas for presentations for next month
just be thinking about that we can
discuss at the at the end of the
meeting. So um agenda item is number
seven is unfinished business. The first
item under that is subcommittee reports.
Um, I will start with uh marketing.
Quinton, do you guys have anything right
now? We do not have anything at this
time.
Okay. Master plan.
Um the master plan committee met today
and uh spent most of our time discussing
um the the uh asset disposition
processes and you know pondering a
little bit about how we might look at
that in the future and analyze some of
the lands that parks has and and how
best to use them. Um, also we asked uh
the parks department to provide online
access to the 2021 master
plans. So 2001
or 2001, excuse me, 2001 master plans.
Thank you.
Any questions for the um master plan
subcommittee? I think that's Mike Canon
and JT I believe.
Sam. Sam. Sorry. It's okay. It's because
I'm so tall. That's right.
Um, we still love you, though. Thank
you. Or I I do. We both get forgetting
from time to time, don't we?
All right. Okay. The the last one is
Parks Conservancy. Um, I think it's me
and Sam. I have no report. I don't know.
Sam, if you have anything. I I have I I
actually was able to go to the last
meeting. Um and uh one of the biggest
things I think that came out of that
meeting that I'd like to make sure we
talk about uh is something that I think
Happy Peek will talk about better uh was
the fundraising event that we're you're
planning and having. So if you want to
give a few details or recap anything.
Sure. Um and and I I so appreciate uh I
was at the last meeting too um the parks
conservancy interest uh in in helping us
get the word out and being there. And
just if you go to the restaurant side
that's okay. We'll direct you. It's
actually in Trio's pavilion room which
is the private dining room next to the
restaurant. It has its own private
entrance but we're very used to
directing people to the right place. Um,
I'm so excited about this and this
actually uh someone who does not live in
my ward but near my ward uh planted this
seed in my brain a few months ago. Uh
she and her family uh frequented
Reservoir Park and wanted to do
something that helped and bounced a few
ideas off of Leland, met with Graham and
met with the confer conservancy and so
we have a date. Uh we have a goal of
$25,000.
Um, I am uh donating the the food and
adult libations. I also had a little
leftover campaign money. So, I'm going
to pony up
$2500, not $25,000, but that is our
goal. $2,500
uh as some seed money to get this
started. Uh, you know, Reservoir is such
a beloved park and there's so many
people that use it, not not just the
Leewood neighborhood that backs up to
the park. Uh the playground's exciting.
Uh when we had a meeting about a year
ago uh with the Ward 4 residents who
were really impacted by the tornado and
lived in the uh proximity of reservoir.
We had a presentation from Cromwell and
a big map and everybody got three push
pins and they were able to uh designate
what were the three most important
things to them in that park that they
would like to see back and disc golf was
in the top three. So that's really why
we decided to uh use this money for this
particular fundraiser for disc golf and
then to help uh additional funds for the
playground. Right, Leland?
That's correct. Thank you. And so that
that's it. I I just would really
appreciate you all showing up and
supporting the event. Uh we'll get a PDF
or something that we can all share. Uh
maybe Graham the only thing I would
maybe change is and I can under the logo
maybe Trio's pavilion room because they
are two separate things but again no big
deal. Um I hope to get a big crowd there
raise a lot of money and uh I hope to
see all of you all there. That's about
it.
Um Director Percludes my report. I had a
quick question. Did y'all talk about the
are they doing the softball fields there
or are those are those gone? Are they
still there? I haven't even the
reservoir. Yeah, reservoir. Yeah. Yes.
As part of the master plan was to
rebuild the um existing ball field and
so um Justin's moving forward with the
design and Cromwell will be helping us
uh reconstruct it. We're looking we're
spending more time looking at ways to
improve the ball field whereas where it
was originally located. Not that we're
changing the location greatly or
anything, but how can we improve grading
and drainage? uh because it was poor
poorly handled in the first how it was
originally designed.
It had a short left field too. So yeah,
you could all the not very good hitters
can hit home runs. Maybe we should talk
to you a little bit more about play out
there many. Yes, I'd be I'd love to give
some input in the infield floods like
crazy fixing grading that's going to
help that. That was what I was referring
to was the challenge behind I mean you
can't even get in there for days after
it rains it seems like. Um one of the
things I saw there being a resident like
a couple blocks away was uh there was a
lot of people for a while playing
cricket in there. I don't I tried to
meet I never was able to get anyone to
really talk to me because I wanted to
see like do they played other fields or
is this the only one? I wasn't really
aware of it, but um I don't know if that
group has ever reached out to you guys
about that or they're just using it. I
mean, which is great. I just if there's
something we could add there to make it
useful for them, there might be more
people using it on random days. I agree.
Um I've seen it only because I've
frequent the area. I've seen individuals
down there. They also mow some of the
areas to like their lines or whatever
they need, but um I haven't ever had any
uh contact and I don't know of any
reservations that they've made through
our office. Okay.
On the event on the 21st, how how are
they going to
be giving the money? Is it electronic?
Is it check? I just I don't know if we
should have something on the flyer.
That's I don't know if we can do a
gofundme or I'm trying to figure out the
best. No, I'm sorry I interrupted. Go
ahead. No, I was just trying to figure
out how for those who can't make it.
Hey, if you can't make it, there's still
a way to That's a good idea. provide
donations. So, I'm assuming all the
money will go to the parks conservancy,
right? Since it's a write off, I'm
assuming. And there and the parks
conservy's working on graphics and some
other things that will make it easy with
um a code and we'll have a square there.
You can write a check also. Okay, that's
a really good idea. Uh because there
will hopefully be some people that would
want to support regardless of being able
to attend or not in person. My my
understanding is the commission's I mean
not the commission, the conservy's
website has already been updated to
where you can donate to Reservoir Park
today.
Oh, oh, cool. Maybe Graham, I don't know
if you could put something on there that
says, "We'd love to see you in person,
but if you can't make it, you know, go
to this website
to checking it now, but go to this
website to donate online." Something
like
that. That would be great. Just I think
a lot of people support this, but not
everyone can make the actual event.
Are you looking at it? Y I don't I don't
see it yet. They are talking uh mostly
about Impact the Rock, which is coming
up first on the 26. Yeah. So, I don't
see it on there yet. Okay.
That's a great idea. Okay.
Um next unfinished businesses commission
ideas goals for 2025. I think we can
talk more about this in the quarterly
site visits. That was kind of one of my
ideas to have. Um so I think the first
one uh is scheduled for our site visit.
It's not quarterly. It's going to be
three times a year for 2025.
Um, so the first one is April 24th at 4
PM um to tour MacArthur Park and then uh
I've talked to AMFA and they're going to
have some tables outside for us so we
can have some food and drinks and
fellowship. Um, so I would love for
y'all to be there. Just a just a way for
us to hang out and get to know each
other outside of these monthly meetings,
but also we get to get to tour the
uh to tour the Macarthur Park and just
see all the grounds that's uh accompany
that new AMFA. So, any questions on
that? There were other two dates that we
talked about and
I I mentioned it in my email but
um let's
see one second. The other the other two
dates are in yeah July 10th and October
9th. So but April 24th at 4 p.m. is the
first event. So I hope you guys can make
it.
Can you repeat those date dates? So,
April 24th at 400
pm at MacArthur Park and then we'll have
some food and
beverages after that.
Um July 10th at 400
p.m. either at Southwest Community
Center or West Central Community Center
and October 9th at 4 pm at Boil Park.
So, hope we can take some pictures and
document the event for us. And those
dates are also listed in your minutes.
Okay.
So,
um, really the I guess the the last one
or two things and I finished business
because they kind of overlap each other,
but it's the presentation. Um, so we
actually held a special meeting on March
19th to go through the presentation. Um,
I will be presenting to the board uh the
presentation.
[Music]
May
May look in the minutes at some point in
May. I think it's the first board in
May.
Um so uh but anyway, we would I would
like to just March 19th we went through
it. Uh since then I've added pictures
and wanted to see if Mahogany can bring
up the presentation to have any last
minute additions because this is we're
not going to meet before I present in
May. So
um if you could pull that up Mahogany
that would be awesome. And just to
interject uh site visits remember
they're not they're just off-site
gatherings. They're not official
meetings to correct. Make sure everybody
there's no decisions being made or
anything like that. It's fellowship.
Thank you. Thank you.
I got my calendar.
It's on the
Okay. Yeah. So, May six is when I'll be
presenting just the overview of what we
what we did in 2024. Um, go to next
slide,
please. So, these are the table of
contents.
Um, next slide, please.
So, this gives us their commission
members. Um, I think we can take Quincy
Grant off. I don't think he's a member.
Um, I'll be sure to take that off. Okay,
next
slide. Responsibilities of commission.
This is just a overview of what we do.
Um, this is from the bylaws, but I made
it just a little a very high level
overview of of
that. Please, you guys comment if you
see anything. Next slide, please. Go
back, Ben. Back. Go back. Go back,
please.
It's minor, but there's a comma instead
of a period. Or or do you want commas at
the end of all of those? Those two at
the top. Yeah, there should be commas at
the end of all those. Thank you. I'll
I'll change
that. Okay, there's just our mission and
vision.
Um, and I don't have a lot of time, so
I'm probably going to be speeding
through this uh at the actual board
meeting. I want to talk about the
subcommittees formed and meeting.

we did to help with the uh sales tax.

slide. There's key highlights. Thank
you, Canon, for providing that.
Here's a

at these meetings. Yep. Yep. The
highlighted highlighted ones have come

Sorry. Questions. And then there's the
appendence at the end that has lists the
actual bylaws of what we do.
I have a question, Leland. Shouldn't we
add Kowana
Spark or what? Could we get a photo
before then? We can absolutely. Yeah. I
mean, there's Graham Simulith. Were
there Kuanas in there, Graham? I don't
know.
There's so many more.
So, but we can add Kuanas if I'm just
trying to think of including everybody
to the city, right?
Cuz it
was is it like
uh Kanes where it's been open for a
little bit but just not officially
opened or we opened it officially at the
end of last year. Okay, that's what I
was thinking. and I just couldn't
remember the exact but it's a it's a key
project and we discussed it several time
again this is y'all's presentation but I
think it's projects that
kind of came through this this from an
advisory board level discussion and all
that good stuff.
So, okay, we'll get Kuanas Park add it
and
uh I think we
Well, can we get any additions or not,
Simone? Do we have to vote on it now?
You need a motion and then you can vote
on it. But we can't have any other
changes then after today.
in I could talk about it
direcas. Is that okay? If there's the if
you agree to the changes now to adding a
picture on Kuanas and adding the words
Kowanas to this presentation along with
the commas on removing the member uh
Quincy Grant and approve it with those
changes, then you can make those changes
and present it to the board on May 6th.
Okay. Can I get a motion to approve the
presentation, but also uh taking out
Quincy, adding the commas, and adding
Kuanas Park picture in uh words? I'll
make that motion. All right, Mike has
motion. I'll second it. Second. All in
favor? I. Okay. Thank you. We'll make
the changes and then we'll
be presenting on
May 5th six. Sorry, makes sense. Okay.
Do I need to do anything to add it to
the agenda or how does that work? Is it
on the agenda now? I can add I can Okay,
do that. All right.
Um, please remember to speak into your
mics.
We'll
do.
Um, we talked
about application for commission
vacancies last month and JT brought up a
point
about is the
mayor making the appointments as opposed
to the commission. I think there was
some confusion. I don't know if y'all
talked since then. Simone
currently my understanding is that we
are operating as the ordinance little
rock ordinance and our bylaws say which
is that we now we I'm sorry you the
commission make the appointments and
then recommend make those
recommendations to the city board to
approve.
Okay. I think just because it's been a
couple months since the initial
applications were sent, but I
propose if Mahogany can send out the
applications again in resumeumés and we
can vote on in May or I don't I don't
think any of the members have seen it.
It's probably been a couple months. So,
so let's make an official motion that we
have that happen and then you can have
that done and then we can agree that
we're going to vote on that at the next
meeting or address it at the next
meeting if let's Yeah, let's address and
vote on it.
I I'd like to make some comments. Yep.
So, it is my understanding that the
parks commission is the only commission
that does this. Yes, ma'am. And so, um I
have been talking to some of my
colleagues, BJ, I haven't talked to you
yet, but so I'm talking to you now that
this is perhaps unnecessary and that we
should uh do what all the other boards
and commissions in the city do where it
comes to us. We see the applications,
the mayor makes a recommendation, we
support it or reject it. I don't know,
it just seems like some more hoops to
jump into. And I think it's been on the
books for a long long time. And I'm not
sure why parks was treated differently,
but we're the only one that does
that. I'm I'm just thinking to to get in
the groove with everybody else that we
ought to do it like everybody else. I
mean, I I'd like to hear what you think,
Vice Mayor Hayrick.
The only thing that I would add and I
haven't been to enough meetings to
understand the protocol here but um I
think initially when we set up the
commission we had specific kinds of
talents that we wanted to be on the
commission uh I know like for instance
MacArthur they were always looking for
people that could raise money for the uh
MacArthur birthplace and you know all
that kind of stuff. So, I don't know if
this commission is set up where you have
a focus on people that you want to bring
in to to work on the commission. So,
that would be the only reason why we
might not do it. Um, I didn't realize
that this commission was forwarding to
the mayor who you wanted. We We haven't
been. No, we haven't. That's what the
bylaws say. I mean, I've been the
liaison for this will be my ninth year
and I didn't know anything about nobody
know that was happening. But if you do
have some special people that you're
looking for um maybe somebody has some
sort of architectural skills or just for
example that you wanted to encourage to
be on the commission, that'd be a reason
to keep it the way it is. That's the
only thing I would
say. I I don't know. It just seems a
little cumbersome because we uh when
when people apply, we get the
applications uh the board of directors,
we we get them beforehand. Uh especially
if it's award specific appointment, then
that director would would have some
input, maybe communicate um in executive
session or with the mayor. You know,
this is a person like Sam, no brainer.
He he needs to represent board four.
Now, we may not always ultimately is up
to the mayor. by Sam Ellis. But we but
we get a very thorough Well, you all
have filled out the application, so I
don't know. It just seems a little
cumbersome and and honestly, I don't
know.
I don't know. I don't the benefit. I'm a
I'm want to hear the commissioner speak,
but I'm kind of agree with Dret Peek and
and that I'm not cut the red tape a
little and make this not
so so many steps. um if it's
easier for just to go through the mayor
and the and the and the board and
because if you know someone that feel
like will be good as vice mayor, you
should tell them go apply with the mayor
and the board. Um but that's I'm all
about making a little easier on people.
So I will say that uh the plan is for
the commission to receive the same
information uh that the board would like
you get the same applications of people
who have applied for the commission. Um
and it has been sent to commissioners so
we could review and discuss. Um we just
haven't gotten to that point yet and now
that time has passed. Um so um that that
still would be the pla the case. we
still would not just be um picking just
random people that we know or something
to that effect. It would still be people
that want to be on the board. Um as Vice
Mayor Wyrick mentioned, if you have
someone in mind who has great
fundraising skills or something like
that, then you could encourage them to
apply their application. We get to you
this way. Um however, my in my role, all
I can tell you is that the ordinance and
the bylaws say
this. So we would have to go through the
process of changing that. Yes, we would.
And then back to um if if you know
somebody you think would be a just a
stellar candidate, you know, commu, you
know, communicate with either director
Lewis or with me as the liaison or with
with anybody on the board saying parks
uh really recommends this person for
these reasons. ABC
Ben, I'll offer an opinion. So, you
know, for what it's worth, from my
perspective, it's not like a very
tedious process. And I think it's a good
idea that we would get a list of who's
interested in being on the commission
and then just provide a recommendation,
right? The board gets to choose anybody
on that list regardless of what we
recommend. And I would think that the
board would want to know the How do you
get that list though? I mean, it's got
to be they have to apply first, right?
They have to apply for the whole process
like it exists. But like right now, I
don't know who's who's interested in
being on the commission and who's not. I
don't know. I I I talk to people
sometimes they tell me they I don't know
if they apply or not. I just think it'd
be easy to get a list of who's applying.
If the commission, you know, has some
discussion and then we just make a
recommendation to the board and say,
"Here's two people that we think are the
best." But they the board gets to decide
anyway. And uh I would think that they
would want to know if the commission has
an opinion on it. We might not have any
opinion on we might say we don't know
any of these people but we can work with
anybody. Right.
It is an extra step you know and it you
say it's easy to do
but in any kind of government city state
whatever it's it's a process and it
takes a little bit of time but
what whatever y'all want to do. I I just
know that none of the other boards and
commissions do this. Um, and I I will
say from my experience with Mayor Scott,
he has a pretty good idea of who he
wants. I mean, he he reviews it well
ahead of time and we usually don't have
a whole lot of discussion in executive
session about the boards and
appointments. I mean, he's done his
homework. Uh again, unless it's a ward
specific uh appointment that you know we
might have a personal connection and
some personal knowledge about it, but I
mean it's up to y'all. I just I think
it's funny. I mean Leland, did you even
know anything about this? How long have
you been Absolutely. I've been sitting
on this for many years.
Um, no, but I would like to clarify,
Simone, if you could say, is this that
the commissioners are to review the same
list that the board of directors is
reviewing and then the commissioners are
supposed to provide a list to the board
saying these are the ones that we would
or highlighted or these are the ones
that we recommend. Is that the process
or are we is there more to it than that?
So, um, let me grab your the bylaws real
quick.
The Well, while she's looking that up, I
will concede to you two
that with the process that's in place
and the mayor selecting it and the board
voting on it that it's probably a feudal
exercise for us to review them. I will
agree with that point. I think it is.
Okay. So,
um, all the bylaws say in the bylaws
mirror the ordinance is that the
vacancies on the commission shall be
filled by appointments made by the
commission which must be affirmed by the
Little Rock board of directors. So, in
the discussions as to how this would
look to make this as fair and as
possible and to keep it in line with
what is going on. Um, as Leland has
stated, we can just use the exact same
list. We can make the selections,
highlight them, and send that to the
board. If you wanted to make a specific
recommendation of only these people and
then send that to the board of
directors, you could do that. But I
think that Leland's suggestion is the
best.
Do we need to change the bylaws for
future? To change the bylaws, we would
also need to change the ordinance. Is
that done by the city board? All right.
Okay.
Shouldn't be an issue.
Yeah.
I mean, the way the way that I see it
and and I don't want to bel labor this,
but if this commission just wanted to I
mean, we could send the information. And
I don't know where the how if that's
difficult then maybe it's not feasible
but if it wasn't difficult uh if
mahogany can get it from the city clerk
and we just share it and then at the
next meeting Mike might say hey I think
XYZ person is really great mahogany
could you add that to the list to share
to the board of directors or nobody has
any recommendations nobody had time to
review it and there's nothing
highlighted we don't have any
recommendations
Um, if it's just that easy, then I don't
I wouldn't go through the process of
changing the bylaws. And maybe that's
how it's been handled over the years and
it just kind of fell away because it was
being taken care of. Um, I do see it
that easy. Um,
we the the commission cannot really fill
the position without the board of
directors and so exactly as you're
describing does make sense.
Can I can I get a motion for next month
to recommend
Can I ask one review the current
applications?
Huh? I just had
a
question. Simone, the way you read it
and I I don't have it in front of me. I
apologize. Can you reread the It's like
two sentences.
Yes. Cuz I have a question like on how
I'm understanding it and that could just
be in left field. I just want to make
sure. Okay. Um, vacancies on the
commission shall be filled by
appointments made by the commission
which must be affirmed by the Little
Rock Board of Directors. Okay. So then
what I'm hearing, and please correct me
if I'm wrong, I'm not an attorney, is
that
we, and I understand this isn't how it's
operated for the last however many
years, but the way that's
written, the city clerk gets
applications or however we bring
applications to this committee, correct?
We would thumb up or thumbs
down some amount to go to the board and
then they would select from what we
thumbmed up or sent to them. Is that
what I'm They would approve the people
that you you slipped up. Yes. So it's
basically we call the population and
hand it to them to further do whatever
they want with that population we sent.
Okay. But but the board would have the
original list, right? And if there was
some if there was Bob on there that we
didn't recommend, the board could still
approve Bob to be on the commission.
Correct. That's not how it's worded, I
don't think. I Okay. Well, that's what
that's why I'm asking the question. So,
I don't believe that the board would
have the full list. I think they would
have the list of the people that the
commission suggests. Okay. Well, then I
refrain from what I originally said cuz
I think that's problematic. Okay.
Because
then
Yeah. Well, the mayor is never involved
in any of this, right? Is the way I read
it here. It would be us like taking that
role and not the
mayor, right? I mean, am I the way I'm
understanding it, the powers at this
commission. And I'm not saying that's
good, bad, or indifferent, but that's my
simpleton reading or listening and
understanding of what you're telling me.
So the
So they won't even see the application
until it comes to us, right?
And then if they don't like any of the
people we put forward, they just say,
"No thanks. Send us more." Which is
fine. But the way it's structured, we
would present a single or multiple
people to get further
decision on I guess correct. At this
point it would be three people we would
recommend because there are three
vacancies
or more even I think. And then is this
confirmed that this is an ordinance? So
it actually would take the city to
change this not this board. Okay.
Correct. Okay. That's that's where we
are. Yeah. Okay. Well, okay. As of
today, um I think we just if we can
mahogany can send out
the send out the applications again to
us via email and then we could vote on
it next
month because I just I hate for the
applicants. They probably been are in a
waiting period. It's probably been three
or four months. Um and so maybe we have
a new business next month that we review
and vote on applications.
That is correct. Um, until it's changed,
if it's ever gets changed. Yes. Okay.
And I'm only asking
because my history with the board, I
found out I was on the board like a day
before the meeting I was coming to,
which is fine. Um, I'd put in an
application 6 months before, never heard
anything. You don't really even get a
confirm receipt email. I mean, it's just
sort of a funky structure as it was.
Um, and I'm still in limbo on if I'm on
the board. I'm continuing because we
haven't appointed any new people
whenever you brought up this stuff like
at the beginning of the year like, "Hey,
you're not off yet cuz correct. You
haven't been kicked off basically or
whatever." So, I'm just trying to
understand it. Correct. But, um, we
could I believe we can address that uh
at next meeting as well.
I'm I'll I'll do a bit more research on
that one to make sure or yes it might
just be as simple as putting
your do again if you are wanting to in
the commission.
Okay. All right.
Um if we don't have any other questions,
can we move on to new
business? We need to do some more. I
need you to confirm with a vote that
you're going to make this decision next
month and we're going to add this to the
agenda. Yes. Can someone uh present this
for next month?
Commission members, I'll make the motion
that parks and rec resend the
applicants to the entire commission and
that we will review them and make our
recommendation to the lower rock board
directors at the next meeting. Do we
have a second? Second. Second. All in
favor? I. All
oppose. Okay. We'll be on next month.
Thank you all. Good discussion.
Um uh moving on to new
business discuss special meeting on
March 19th. I think I've already talked
about that. We just we went over the
presentation that I just reviewed. So
there's not going to be a lot of
discussion on that.
If not, then I'm going to move on to
looks like there is a conflict in May
for the May meeting
um with the city of Little Rock employee
appreciation lunch and so we are looking
for new dates
um to do this in May.
Um,
so how does would
May May
15th to
Thursday is currently it it would be
on May
14th. So potentially the next day May
15th at the same time doing it in uh
doing it here. Um, does May 15th work
for everybody? I can never do a
Thursday. Huh? I can never do a
Thursday. Okay. I'd like to suggest
something or make sure that it's clear.
Uh, when staff have conflicts, I
actually u there's a handful of us that
are actually be at a training and Rogers
on that day as well. Oh. Um, but when we
have conflicts, I just want to
reiterate, there was a previous
commissioner that would would not care
for us to change the date. we can have
other staff sit in and and help run the
meeting. Um, just throwing that out
there if you want to save the same date
that we could have a another deputy
director or somebody else could help
facilitate May 14th. Mhm. Okay.
So
any I wanted to talk about this. You
want to keep it at May 14th
and might not Leland won't be here or
some other staff won't be here or we can
move it to May 15th or May
21st was another suggested date, but
I'll I'll be out of town all that the
week of the 19th. So
[Music]
um so I think it's May 14th or May 15th
or if there's another date please let me
know
the discussion so much I'll I'll put my
preference I I prefer to keep with May
14th if we need an abbreviated meeting
so be
it. Any comments?
Shanda.
Okay. Can you go to the
podium? I just wanted you to be aware
that the age uh friendly little rock
commission meets here on the 15th from
12:30 to 1:30.
So I think
uh May 14th it we'll just keep it here
and unless there's any opposing
comments.
Okay, I'm here with a question again. So
the master plan you're going to be in
Rogers, so we need to schedule that a
different time then as well. Okay. I
mean again same kind of concept. you
could still the committee could still
meet and discuss the agenda that we've
set. I just won't be in attendance. Um I
I didn't I mean, you know, obviously I
didn't schedule the training, but this
is a three-year training that I have to
attend and it's just the way that it
fell on the on the calendar. So, no
drama. I was just want to make sure like
I think we should probably have a
different date for what we're doing or
we could meet and get organized, be more
organized for when we meet with Leland
next time. Either way, it sounds good.
Sounds like everything will stay the
same. We'll figure out um on our end who
can actually be here for staff and make
sure we have the meeting can be held as
normal.
Okay. All right. Um that's is the agenda
items for next meeting. I think we've
spoken about a couple already, but are
anything else wants to be added?
Okay. Not seeing anything.
Um, poor leaison
feedback. Director Beck, do you have
anything? I think I've talked about all
of the events.
Vice Mayor Wy, do you have anything?
might have got um a blip about
um commissioners meeting in person as
opposed to
virtual. We passed the law that the city
has the city board has to do that, but
it's not been sent to the commissions
for them to do that. It's Cappy's
Cappy's show. Um so if if you're worried
about that, it's not on any agenda for
the near future. So we're we're still
doing virtual in commissions. Okay.
So, the update is for you all on your
bi-weekly that you all are doing.
Okay. I would advocate for remote or
allowing people to remote in the
commission meetings just so it allows
more people to potentially be a part of
a commission.
Okay. Um I think that concludes the
meeting. Um, we'll see
everyone. Uh, April 24th at 4 PM is our
get together and then May 14th at 11:45
is our next commission meeting. I
clarify that. You said you say on the
24th is 4 p.m. In the meetings it said
in the meeting minutes it says 5:00 pm.
Yeah, it should be 4 pm. I don't know if
that was either. No, I don't know what
happened there, but yeah, it's 4 p.m.
Thank you. Thank you all.
Thank you. You
can we have a motion to adjurnn, please?
I'm sorry. Motion to adjurnn. I'll make
that motion.
I bet. Thank y'all. Oh, we got a vote.
Oh, and all in favor? I
I need to put Yeah.
No. And I saw your applications. I
you're pickled. Yeah, I think I met you.
I thought I probably
play
