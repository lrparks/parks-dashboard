things here um on the agenda items we
did pass last time I talked about two
rivers Trail we did pass that the board
did a that uh fully so we'll be moving
forward with a resurfacing of the
Arkansas River Trail in the two rivers
area that is part of the city of L Rock
um some other future projects that will
be coming uh to the board will be the
West Central ball field complex um a new
ball field to be built there to replace
uh one of the larger Fields there again
this was utilizing um arpa funds that
the board gave us in terms of $1 million
for a new ball field and improvements so
that we'll U we'll be taking that
successful bid to the board as soon as
possible I also see on the horizon taken
a um something for our master plan for
our I30 Crossing uh we have some arpa
funds to help us uh do some master
planning for the uh new downtown Park
area and we've gone through a selection
process uh for that and so we'll be
bringing that to the board shortly um
those are the board agenda items if if
there's any questions please let me know
uh on here too we have Heyman Park
public meeting uh we've had a series of
three uh Heyman uh Master planning
meetings these have all been for uh
Community input and they've all been
located at the Hinman uh Old Pro Shop
and so we've had a lot of great
Community uh input the first one was for
mountain biking for Nika which is a a
planed program there second one was all
about disc golf which is a plan
component there and the third one was a
just a general session I'd say we had
anywhere from 30 to 40 to 50 maybe Max
people at each one so like we got maybe
100 different people at least if not
more than that to give us input and so
we'll start our process on Master
planning and moving forward on that um
also are there any questions for staff
reports or on staff reports we have uh
several of our staff here that can
report on any uh questions and if
there's not any questions I'll turn it
over to Britney for event Justin just a
quick question on the archery range that
the plans are drawn and is that through
arpa as well and for Murray Park is that
Murray Park and through
arpa
okay oh sorry
man no sir that's part of a outdoor
recreation grant submitt that we uh
submitted for and uh so the next phase
would just be hearing if that's uh
successfully awarded and then continuing
to work with G and Fish on the moving
forward
okay any questions for any of the uh
staff reports whether
that's uh go
ahead that
uh great question so no we do not have
any current plans for the area so this
would be a uh firm to design something
for that space um we did complete a
downtown master plan and that was a
general area for the whole downtown and
so this would be a focus on just the 15
acres and the and how does that connect
and everything so it's broader than the
15 Acres but the plan is for the 15
there Lind on that subject somebody had
suggested to me that the underpass on
the I30 might make a useful place for a
covered pickle ball area that it might
be high enough to do that something to
just keep in mind yeah so I would um
suggest we'll have some upand cominging
Community
meetings and I would um you know
recommend that you come and share your
input uh those are all things that we've
already considered and I would say would
be considered but to come share your
community input would be great and that
all be determined you know next year but
um I think it's a good
idea I've got a quick question um have
we rescheduled the ribbon cutting at the
Panky park
yet no
okay thank you
um any other questions for the staff
before we turn it over to Britney to go
over events for upcoming events at the
parts okay

our Facebook page and on the city's
calendar uh we will reschedule that but
also Jim daily will be reopening its
pool within the next month so you'll all
get an email invitation to that grand
reopening any
questions this is great thank you for
all the information and
um a lot of good events coming up I had
a question on the Razer back game how
does does the city L had to clean it up
or is Arkansas clean it up State I guess
State own the state manages that they
have a they have a lease over moral park
for the game itself but don't let me you
know say anything wrong here or Justin
can comment too on this he's heavily
involved but there is a big effort on on
our side too I mean we we remove what
like 15 or 20 trees that were dead and
dying and um clean up the area and we
want to make the park look as good as it
can for all those visitors that come so
um but the state does do all the the
pickup use it no no uh they there is
something in the lease that states
something about damages yeah um but
since it's not a golf course active golf
course anymore there's there's little
damages from what happens out there I
believe so
all right anything else for director's
reports staff reports events I think
that was a really good thorough report
for all everybody so anyone questions
before I turn it over to Shanda to talk
about the summer playground program
highlights I have one more question um
on the senior center Renovations are
those funded in in progress or are those
planned so the senior facility was
funded by $3 million from the arpa fund
we've been working this year on uh
design plans we've um completed the
design plans as of two weeks ago there
were some final comments from the age
friendly commission they we asked them
to share input we've done that a couple
times with them they had a lot of great
input and so we tweaked a few tiny
little things like I mean all the way
down to where do we put the grab bar in
the shower and stuff like that and so um
we're waiting for PT Stanley to provide
those plans back to us uh any day now um
we'll actually I'll be presenting some
of the plans um tomorrow at the uh
Summit at West Central um I'd be happy
to share them here if there was a
request uh next month um we the plan is
to actually bid it
um in the month of October minus these
changes and stuff and so we'll know
something about the bid and the cost
somewhere around when the um sales ta
vote is completed uh what's important
there is that in the sales tax vote
there's another 3 million allocated for
this project which is definitely needed
um but we can
definitely go forward with some aspect
of it with the 3 million that's that's
set there thank you y what are the main
items that are going to be included in
it or in the senior facility yeah so if
you do or not know it's this facility
here so there are uh significant
modifications to the interior of this
facility um but the biggest changes in
the the money of the cost is we're
adding onto the back of the building
here all the way to the edge of the
parking lot basically expanding as far
as we can go south and in that space is
a new uh therapeutic pool that's uh 30
by3 I believe um that would be on this
far side the West Side uh then there's
locker rooms that would be added to we I
mean it was really challenging to do
this but I think we've had a great team
so we've figured out how to add on to
the existing restroom so if you walked
into the men's room or women's room you
could actually walk through the wall
That's the outside wall today and go
into the locker room space so we don't
have to build new rest rooms we'll use
the facilities that are here but they'll
have locker rooms so you can change and
then on the far side or the east side of
the building we're extending a room over
there and making an exercise space um so
it'll be you know cardio and different
weights and stuff and then there'll be a
new entrance which has always been a
little bit lacking on on this South Side
original entrance when it was planned
for this building was on the east side
at the drop off nobody ever uses that so
we're actually changing that so it's not
confusing anymore and we'll have a new
grander entrance with a um Plaza small
Plaza but still functional Plaza and a
um office desk and office area um some
of the bigger things if we were to pass
the sales taxes we do have a warming
kitchen back here we're expanding that
we're taking out some of the storage
area and some of the office space and
expanding it and preparing it for a
commercial kitchen we really believe we
need a commercial kitchen here if we're
going to operate as a senior facility
however commercial kitchen would be
anywhere from a half million to a
million dollars to full full you know
buildout so if the sales tax passes
we'll build it out if it doesn't pass
it's just going to still be a warming
space that's a little bit bigger
those kind of things also in the site
plan we originally were trying to build
out a pickle ball complex because of the
site constraints cost a lot of different
issues um we've sized that down to four
um courts pickleball courts with a
middle court that is for um kind of all
kind of different games would be a Turf
space that people could could have fun
entertainment in and smaller maybe ball
games or whatnot um and that's that's at
the southern end of the parking lot and
so that most likely unless we just got
really great bids or something would be
part of that additional 3 million too so
and so if I'm if I'm hearing it it's
taken up parking spaces or it's not
taking up any parking it's taking a
little bit of the there's some weird
elongated parking over here on the far
west side and we're cleaning that up um
we're also cleaning up all the
accessibility concerns we're making a
lot better access more uh handicap
parking and the parking lot
um and those kind of improvements uh
some of the improvements in here just
another there's a lot of little changes
in terms of furniture and amenities but
um we we're going to make this space
where The Far Side the north side would
be set with tables and chairs for a
normal day all the time so people can
come and socialize we felt like we
needed more window space so in the plan
there's to in that far back corner is to
put in glass walls there so they would
open up to the the the wall the windows
that go out to the north end so then you
can get some of that feel in here and
have that space set up and then you
could still have programming in here
with this screen and and different
seminars and whatnot but still be able
to do a full um banquet in here if you
wanted to move the furniture so we've
really tried to squeeze everything we
can out of a 20,000 foot building is
what I think it'll end up being so and
what's the current footprint versus with
the right so I think it's adding what
roughly three to five and we have 15
roughly now I think those are rough
numbers cool yeah I'm glad you able to
use the plumbing I mean like that's a
huge yeah there's actually a lot of
challenges though in terms when you
mentioned that there's a lot of the
plumbing electrical that are that feeds
the building currently on this back wall
so we've come up with some unique ways
to change that but there's definitely
some expense there with the pool and
some other things we're definitely
having to upgrade utilities which is
another huge cost so we're concerned
about where the money is going to come
in the budget but it's what it is so
thank you you anticipate that this new
facility with the expanded opportunities
would be open five days a week for
seniors to use or is it just by
reservation it wouldn't be just by
reservation if Shan if you want to
answer the the how many days we we have
a we're working through our staff layout
right now and our programming um but you
know we don't have we have senior
facilities already and we have senior
programming at our existing community
centers but then we've we've been
running around discussing what our
options are on on fees and memberships
and I don't even really think we have
the the hours 100% Define but if if you
want to speak a little bit to
that absolutely not we don't have all
the the uh details uh finalized yet but
we uh do plan to operate more than um
maybe up 6 days a week possibly um if we
you going know follow the the prints
that we've seen with at other locations
so we just want to make sure that we're
uh being competitive with everyone else
I'd like to add to that too so part of
this
is obviously we don't have in our 2024
budget to operate this facility we don't
have the staff we have some staff here
but a lot of staff were cut here back
early on um and so in the 2025 budget
request that I have I've asked for some
funding um by the board to allocate to
this facility for staff so if we get the
staff and we have more staff more
programers and stuff like that that that
will allow us to make more decisions on
our hours um but we don't have that
decision yet we'll have that coming soon
um and we see that I mean with the
project if it's successfully bid in
November
and then we have the funding to do what
we wherever we stand with the sales tax
everything else the goal would be is to
start construction first of next year
hopefully you know be up and running by
mid year or you know third quarter of
the year so that's why we're asking for
the funding for the staff and our goal
is to we've already started to
reclassify the staff that's in this
building and to to handle that but we
definitely believe with this facility in
the existing senior programming and
aspects that we all have is that we
really need a senior coordinator for the
whole area we have one right now over
aging and active is what it's called um
but with this facility we really need to
have somebody that can take on the lead
of this facility and and cover the rest
so anyway a lot to it Le one quick note
too um when you talked about
accessibility there is such a thing as
wheelchair pickle balls so
if people can get access to the courts
it might be something that could SP up
in the future that's um a good note we
hadn't we hadn't discussed um wheelchair
pickle ball but um because of our our
guidelines and standards for
accessibility these facilities have been
designed to be fully accessible um it's
been challenging because of the grade
and we have to raise it and all that but
there is a sidewalk that will take off
from right here the entrance of the
building and and run in that green space
and at all the way up to the pickle ball
court so there will be accessible pickle
ball courts
here okay let's move to uh presentation
shawanda if you can uh kind of give us
some highlights on on the summer
playground Pro program I know we're all
anxious to hear about it because I know
it's it's a great program that a lot of
young kids can take advantage of during
the
summer yes good afternoon there you want
to come
I would like to introduce darl Marley
he's our uh Recreation program
coordinator for athletics and this is
his program um you want to say
something um well I mean I think we're
doing great well our numbers are coming
back around uh since covid we had you
know couple of sites that we no longer
have we went from 10 sites we're back up
to six sites
we dropped to five now we're back up to
six site so hopefully next year we'll
add another site uh our Max numbers well
we try to get between 1,300 uh a year
when we're fully staffed and we fully
have all our locations this year we're
at 587 compared to the year before when
we was at
524 so it's coming back around and with
the new activities that we have added
for our youth they're starting to enjoy
it again more so hopefully we'll have
have a very very successful uh
20225 next next
slide okay so I'll just talk about the
aims the aim of this program was is to
was to offer a safe and nurturing
environment where children can engage in
supervised organized and meaningful
recreational activities while school is
not in session uh we're also introducing
our team Camp tailored to meet the
interest and needs of participants
excuse me uh ages 12 to 15 um and so uh
here are some of the activities that
they participated in this year um we
added a few new things um top golf they
went to a stage uh stage play at the
Robinson which was um a a movie and a
play uh and they also went to U the
presidential library and they wrapped up
the end of the year at Main Event
um and what we try to do at our team
Camp because our other locations are
much 6 to 15 team Camp is I'm sorry but
team Camp is 12 to 15 so they have
different you know needs that they have
and different activities that they like
so what we tried to do team Camp try to
uh tailor those locations to things that
we know they would enjoy uh so that's
what we're looking at and that's what we
continue to grow and go to next
slide uh and uh like I said uh we had we
hired 28 staff uh for each well total
for the summer uh for our locations uh
which it was still down I think I'm a
lot at 45 but it's just hard to get
people who want to work
uh we keep pushing uh we're going to
schools trying to recruit people who's
in the recreation field uh trying to
bring them on board and probably trying
to give them some uh internships like I
did when I came through the program I
went through an internship through
Henderson State University uh through
the school to start working for the city
of lck and we're trying to piggy back on
that hopefully it pick back up and we
can start getting people from Arkansas
Tech who has a recreation department
Henderson uh Pine Bluff and other
entities fville throughout the state of
Arkansas that are going to be here in
the summertime uh our numbers for each
site like Bale Elementary is one of my
locations we had 86 Chico we had 98 Hall
this year only had 28 when usually we
have 150 but we're trying to bring it
back we move locations from uh J Fair we
were at Hall this year uh and I think
that played the part Dumar was maxed out
at 210 each L Rock had 45 which we
allotted 100 there uh and Stevens had
120
okay that's it also um we we did a pilot
program at the West Central Community
Center it was called Youth in Action uh
Camp um and the aim of of this program
is to uh get your moving and excited
during the summer and having them learn
something new in a new environment
exposing them to new adventures
throughout the summer a summer to
remember um they had 105 campers this is
the first time this location has had um
its own um summer camp so uh things went
well they had a a staff ratio uh 1 to7
um and they had a great year summer
is that different from the playground
yes playground so what's the big
difference I I'll wrap it up in just a
second oh sorry okay um as I said uh the
the Youth in Action pilot program is
where every child is where every U
challenge is an invitation to grow and
every activity chance to Glow um these
are just pictures of different
activities that they did there at the
West Central Community
Center we also next SL yes we also had a
sarette program at the at the Southwest
Community Center um the suette program
is more educational based and stem based
um program it's been going on for
probably like 10 10 12 years um at the
Southwest Community
Center they had next slide at 164
campers to participate and the purpose
of uh the program is to provide a safe
and productive uh environment for youth
ages 6 to 15 consisting of endless
Recreation and educational opportunities
including but not limited to so they did
fishing education girls in stem Camp a
youth Summit uh golf at first te cows uh
mes Fest and several other indoor
outdoor recreational activities uh and
games so overall with the three um
summer camps we had
856 participants that we Serv as this
summer uh the summer playground program
the Youth in Action and the
Sarat um programs are as I mentioned are
three different programs what we plan to
do for 2025 is to marry all three of the
those uh programs together to provide
more opportunities and experiences for
the children uh at all of our locations
um some kids don't get to go to swim or
um go skating but we want to provide
more opportunities more experience we we
have also Incorporated our outdoor
recreation Pro uh coordinator into um
the summer camps this summer so they've
did archery um so we plan to do um
canoeing and other bird watching and
other um outdoor activities to uh
incorporate into our summer camps for
next summer so that's our plan moving
forward any
questionsa love these programs um how do
we communicate the availability of these
programs do we ever do like handouts at
school before it goes out or or how yes
yes we do we do flyers and as Daryl
mentioned a lot of Daryl staff um our
our former uh School teachers and so
they help us get the word out and some
of them have been with us for 10 to 12
years um teaching in the summer help
helping us with our summer program we
have Britney here and she she puts our
word out we also have our social media
outlets and and all that and we we just
share the word most people are repeat
all the the campers are repute customers
I would say they come back every year so
we want to like Daryl said we want to
increase our numbers we used to have up
to 1300 before covid and you know we're
trying to make those numbers uh rise
again do you have like a view that you
use internally that shows where all the
children come from and whether all the
wards are being represented or not no um
you want
to what we try to do we try to put uh a
site at each War that's what we try to
do which helps uh try to make sure that
every Ward is covered uh and and then
what what have happened lately is that
because the school district are getting
work done at some of the school we're
kind of limited of what schools we get
now uh because of they're getting work
done at those schools like say inant
Romine Romine we've been there uh
probably 30 years uh but we hadn't been
there the last couple of years and that
location is one of the one that I can
when I open up registration on May 1st
uh May 2nd is full so as we move forward
as the schools finishing their work
we'll know what locations where we're
going to be but it's always going to be
one we're going to put one in each Ward
cuz we want to make sure that all the
wards are taken care of which they have
an opportunity because at $100 for a 8we
program where we feed them breakfast and
lunch I think that's a good
deal so you're doing I'm sorry it's all
the community centers in addition to
school locations that's correct okay
that's good to know I only thought I
only knew about the community centers I
think no ma'am we we we use uh uh I'm
sorry schools we like I said bail uh
Chico Hall uh in the past we've been
probably at all the schools plasy hies
that's City run not District I knew the
schools were open but that falls
under Parks Parks and Recreation yes
that was the mix
up question so does the $100 include uh
lunch and breakfast what what meals or
snacks are included and is that funded
through a separate program yeah uh what
what we've done we're partnered with the
L Rock School District and they do our
meals because I refuse to give our kids
a cold uh breakfast and a cold lunch
we're not doing that one of them has to
be hot so what we do we feed from 7:30
to 8:30 breakfast and then from between
11: and 1 we do uh lunch at each one of
the location now keep in mind people in
the public can come to our locations and
eat they don't have to be in our program
to eat we just need to know the number
uh how many kids are going to show up so
we ask kids that they come in hey are
you coming back and we make sure we plan
to have them a meal so no kids left
hungry so that funding for those meals
comes from the school
district what it is they get funding
they get reimbursed for the meals the
federal funding so they're taken care
of so who pays for the employees is that
City or is that the school that come out
of the city
budget any other
questions thank you for your time and
really appreciate it it's really good
information and just you know as we look
for 2025 just let us know what the
commission can do to increase the
numbers or come up with new activities
new ideas I think I think maybe starting
to plan that next couple months it's
going to be somewhere before we know it
so yes thank
you yes
how how are you going well you were
talking about like Roman as your example
and I'm sorry I know I'm just processing
it um how do you like what kind of
advanced notice do you get from the
school district or how does that sort of
communication flow I know sometimes
things happen at the last second you
know I mean like how does that pretty
much uh I reach out to them like when we
finished and I won't get a word back
until probably March the end of March
beginning of April because as they go
through their schedule they have to see
where they're going to be far as doing
floors and different things like that
right but we already have our stuff in
place far as the field trips uh Staffing
I try to staff Everybody by spring break
because I do deal with teachers and
teachers AIDS so uh I can interview them
during their spring break so when it's
time registration start May 1 I'm
already ahead of the game and trying to
get everything uh situated
okay appreciate it yeah I would just
like to use this opportunity to plug in
we did receive $2 million for our
community centers uh that $2 million uh
went really fast in terms of
improvements uh Justin could update us
on all all four different sites that
we're doing major updates on if there's
any questions uh I'll leave that up to
him in terms of answering those
questions but we have a lot of major
projects that we're doing but there's
we've also realized Iz there's millions
of dollars of more need and that's
another plug for the sales tax is that
sales tax would give us over $1 million
for improvements at our community
centers we can't continue to operate
programs like the summer playground if
we don't have the facilities with air
conditioners and stuff like that and
I'll just give you another little window
of what we work with uh at Stevens
Community Center we were doing some
major improvements there with the AR
funds painting cleaning all this great
stuff somebody decided to go over and V
Iz our major air conditioning system
they did it while it was running and
they tore out the copper out of the unit
um as a result of
$127,000 vandalism uh so we have to just
come up with
$127,000 that's not budgeted uh yes I've
turned it in for insurance uh yes our
deductible is $100,000 so I might get 25
Grand or 27 Grand to help offset
$127,000 cost so those are the reasons
why what we talk about here is so
important in sharing so we can't operate
the programs that we need to operate for
the citizens if we don't have the
facilities and the funding to do it
and let's uh just for the sake of time
it's 12:40 but I think maybe next month
maybe we can have a just a presentation
maybe from Justin to talk about the
improvements at the uh at the four
community centers I think it'll be
helpful what's going on there so um I
have one more follow-up question real
quick um how do we
help you all like because it looks like
some of the community centers are maxed
out like Stevens
dunar uh West
Central Southwest it looks like those
are sort of reaching like 100 200 kids I
mean they're sort of maxing
out what what can we do with the school
district ourselves like individually
here to help create that PLL that
they're helping you a little bit ahead
of time but then
also if if there was an unlimited budget
could you have more kids at these
locations or you tapped Out on Just
space like Leland said air conditioned
space or you know Food Service space or
you know whatever the constraints might
be well got to keep in mind also we do
have other uh organizations who offer a
similar Program in those in these areas
as well but we also got to keep it in
mind we supposed to have a 1 to 22 race
ratio so we have to be careful with that
because child care licensing require us
to make sure that we have that ratio
staff per kid so and plus spacing is
very important uh so the thing is we
don't want to cram 150 kids and then you
only have three spaces let's take
Steven's Community Center you know 120
is really stretching because they only
really have three rooms that's the gym
and two other spaces so things like that
we have to take into account when we're
planning for our program
okay have the outside the playground
areas too to
uh and it's not like back in my day when
I came through the program 50 years ago
we were actually a outdoor program
that's why it's called a playground
program but now because of it's getting
so hot and parents complain a lot we
can't be outside like pretty much our
program we move inside at noon and
they're in for the day because it gets
so hot so we have to take that into
account as well awesome all right let's
uh move forward to unfinished business
um the only thing I kind of want to talk
about here is as of last month we have
three uh subcommittees with master plan
social media and con
Conservancy um I I don't think we need
to have a report every month but I was
just wanting to open up for discussion
about you know if you if if you guys if
the if the subcommittee did meet or want
to have want to talk about anything they
want to during this meeting I think
that's fine um but just for the sake of
just time I think you know email me and
um and and Leland if you if you want to
have some comments about the
subcommittee I know social media met
already I don't know if you guys want to
add anything but uh I think that's if
and I'm opening to discussion if that's
something you guys want to do or if you
guys want to have a meeting subcommittee
agenda every month
but I'm open for discussion but go
ahead I'm sure I uh I would recommend
doing if if if they met to have a report
about what they met about um I think
that'd be helpful for everyone um so for
instance in the um social media
subcommittee um we met
about about I think a week ago um we
talked about several issues including an
overall marketing strategy you know to
to help out Britney um in her job and
and and where we want to focus time to
build out her capacities right she's
only one person but if we want stronger
content do we need to find you know a
third party content person you know
these things like that of where we want
to put our Focus so we're and we're you
know want to work within the all the
master plans to make sure that we're
highlighting those um something else we
talked about was essentially changing
the name for the committee purposes
instead of social media committee maybe
calling it marketing committee so we're
looking at the way to to go about doing
that and and and really we looked at
some of the uh marketing from other
um uh cities around that kind of size up
to L rock or maybe be a little bit
bigger and let us you dream like I think
San Diego was one we looked at we looked
at Grand Rapids we looked at several
others that um Britney uses to you know
get ideas and and and and compare us to
them and you know our overall goal is to
get the word out about the great things
like the summer program and and and and
and and all the stuff that Leland and
his team are doing so um I think we we
we got we had a really productive
meeting and and hope to have another one
in the future here pretty soon great
anything on Master Plan of Park
Conservancy thank you okay well yeah
just going forward if you want
to is same are you the chair of the
master plan now no JT is JT so if JT is
listening um I'll just say that we we're
in the process of a lot of Master
planning um and we always kind of are so
finding out a way to maybe get the group
that subcommittee involved in those you
know at least having one of yall
represented at one of those we have some
future projects um we're we're looking
forward to doing some uh Community input
and master planning on war moral we
already have have some master planning
there but similar like Hinman and we've
been going through that process we'll
continue our design and processing of
Master planning on different projects so
we're always ready uh for Grant and
sales tax dollars and anything else that
we get so I would uh recommend trying to
figure out how we can work together get
you involved in those
meetings real quick so Leland I heard
you say before that in I've seen the
latest master plan but I heard that
there was one before that and I'm on
that committee so um that you thought
might have some more information if
that's possible can you distribute that
so yes just to confirm you're talking
about our overall master plan for our
department the way I understood it from
you was there's the the legest master
plan but then there was one before that
that had different information in it yes
we actually have I believe three or
three and a half master plans so the one
I reference or used to reference a lot
was our 2001 master plan plan uh it has
a lot of visionary sections in it
whereas our latest 2020 is more of an
assessment almost master plan so um
anyway yes we can make sure that you can
get access Britney do you know if that's
on our website it
is
right okay and do that can you give me a
clarification because I saw the
discourse from the last meeting so if I
wanted to ask JT to request that from
Leland I'm not allowed to do that
outside of a meeting
correct I think the problem comes when
you have Parks
Commissioners corresponding about Parks
business through email in current case
law says that at a certain point in time
when you go back back and forth and
start to make decisions and start to
agree on things that that becomes a
meeting a public meeting the problem is
that public meeting was conducted
through email where it there was no
media notification and there there was
no chance for the public to attend
that's a violation of open meeting law
Arkansas Freedom of Information Act that
could carry criminal sanctions for
violation of that act so you really
don't want to get to that point if you
have a request to make uh I would have
one commissioner make that request
through Leland couch director of the
parks
department okay all right let's
okay thank you all right let's go ahead
and get to new business I think this is
kind of the meat the uh the meeting um
you know last month I talked about how
the parts commission uh can assist the
sales taxs initiative whether that's we
I think what I asked is maybe to if you
have any ideas to to think of it over
the past month I I I for sure as chair
want to want to write a letter to The
Gazette and have it in the opinion or SE
that's something I want to work on I
just might need help
with them to actually publish it I guess
is one thing so but uh wanted just to
you know maybe we can take a few minutes
and if you have any other suggestions to
help you know us get the word out about
the sales tats initiative that's the
votes coming up in November
um any anything any
discussion about this um besides you
know social media
and other other forms of marketing that
might be
online open to discussion
um so so are you talking about writing a
letter like to the editor in the
prospective section of the paper and
then having all of us sign it kind of
like we did a letter to the board about
how we were support of it or are you
talking we yeah I mean I think we could
have all of us our names listed in there
um if you guys are okay with that
um I'm open to anything I think that
that might have better weight than than
just me
um more people that are on the
commission there's more people that
might that might know you so Mr chair
what I would suggest is if if you have a
draft letter U that that you would be
proposing to present that to this
commission and the Commissioners and
have them review it and then it would be
a vote kind of like we did with the
previous letter okay I I would recommend
that several individuals write an oped
piece I think that has more weight than
just one lengthy one because every body
has a different reason and a different
perspective and they're pretty good
about publishing those I'm writing one
now about the litter campaign uh also
other good ways if you're a member of
you know rotary or civan or any of those
service organizations your HOAs your
poas um one big opportunity is National
Night Out is coming up on October 1st uh
and for the first time this year there
will actually be a Citywide celebration
at war memorial but you know getting you
know just talking to your neighbors and
and being well-versed about the parks
piece I think that that can speak
volumes but I like the opad idea but I
would say you know some of you that that
are most passionate from your own
perspective because everybody's just
different write write your own opad and
get several in there so Beth for any of
we have to present it to the board
whether even if it's if it's not even
part of the parts commissioner just say
Ben France is writing a letter if it's
the viewpoint from the parks Little Rock
Parks and Recreation Commission yes but
as director PC said if each individual
commissioner as a citizen can also
submit a letter from that person's
particular perspective and Beth can they
say as as a member of the parks and rec
commission or sure sure as a member of
the Little Rock Parks and Recreation
Commission this just would not be a
letter from the Little Rock Parks and
Recreation
Commission Okay so I think for my letter
I'll write it as a commission and I'll
have
it I'll present it for you next month
but encourage everyone to write their
own letter and if you need help on where
to send it or just
proofreading um I guess can they do that
or not if they send it to Linda hey can
you proofread this is that part of Parts
Recreation business state that question
again if if I want to write a personal
letter to Democrat go and I want Leland
to proofread it no it would just be your
personal letter okay from from you I
butt in one more time it's my specialty
apparently um I would say okay I'm most
passionate about the sports complexes or
I most passionate about the community
centers or the senior center and kind of
pick and choose and cover all the things
that I'm I'm a I'm a I'm a fan of Hinman
or war memorial or I want to see
improvements at rbson because that will
touch everything so whatever you're most
passionate about I would just speak
about that because it can be
overwhelming what all is covered by that
okay I encourage you all to to write a
letter Mike pickle ball seems to be uh
your passion so but I'm not I'm not
calling out but uh but anyway yeah I
think that's a good idea to have some
personal letters and then also I'll
write a letter on behalf of the parts
and Recreation that we can vote on next
month um because I think month is the
last month we last time we meet before
the actual election happens
so is there
a from the old tax that's rolled off are
there public projects or I guess that
doesn't even have to be related to the
old tax that fell off but um like say
rebman tennis center the pickleball
courts at Kanis are there areas where uh
the city or parks and rack Department
can put up almost like those you see
them on the side of the road saying you
know you're one C at work you know when
they're doing a road Improvement or
whatever you know delivered on time is
there something like that that we can
put at different locations in the parks
that are recent improvements to just let
people know those things aren't free and
like there's a would say you know that
tax fell off in uh almost three years
ago or so so all the projects are I mean
they're not new projects anymore um I
think going forward when the sales tax
passes and we're able to build something
new or improve something new there
there's an opportunity definitely to do
that and that's the kind of stuff we did
when we had the sales tax previously but
okay yeah um and I just take this
opportunity to if there's any general
questions on the sales tax um I know
it's coming to the end and I'd be happy
to answer anything even if it was uh
quickly after or whatnot but the biggest
change just for everybody to realize too
uh the board did make this final change
and I don't think I've reported it out
yet was it on the uh outdoor sports
complex it dropped from 60 to
55 um there were some reasons behind
that that I won't get into from just
other uses of that funds and so all the
projects are still there it's 58 38 um I
also would like to highlight the fact
somebody mentioned this to me the other
day and I thought it was kind of
interesting was you know we talk about
always about the big number 300 million
for L Rock Parks or 600 allog together
all these big numbers you have to recall
or remember that that's um over a
10-year period so um a lot of these
projects aren't going to start like that
first year a lot of the projects um are
going to be funded over the 10-year
period um so this is an ongoing this
isn't just one big check day one um and
so realistically it's it's roughly you
know 50 or $60 million a year um of
improvements which is great it's just to
let people understand it's it's a it's a
long stride and then it continues too
with the um onm side of things I had a
lot of questions about that recently all
these projects have Staffing and and
funds for maintenance and operation so
um
anyway as a
follow because it is a 10year
period be more urgent and and more
visible and right you might want to get
those started so people can see their
money at work is there a timeline
already established for priority of
projects or has that uh not not complet
completely no um a lot of them for
example if you look at like the indoor
sports complex so we have no funds you
know we haven't purchased any kind of
location or anything like that there's a
lot of due diligence that has to happen
and then those kind of projects like
that aren't designed and like
prepackaged and ready to go so we'd have
to go through a design process so even
even if this you know when this passes
and we start the process we wouldn't be
ready to probably build out a
significant size project like that for a
few years um and so there's not a a time
frame for for all the projects no um I
know there would be definitely some that
would initiate right off and there and I
don't want to speak towards the other P
but I'm sure there's some great projects
that would kick right off but the our
bigger projects would would take a
little bit of effort in
design and and you make the point too
that a lot of these previous sales tax
we had to wait like Western Hills for
example received a million dollars or
just short of that because of where the
money came in we that was one of the
ones that we waited eight or 10 years to
really get the bulk of that money and
then we did the project so other F other
ones might be short-term finance and the
money pays back there's a lot of
different ways to do it so
all right um do you want to talk about
the pickleball tournament Leland when
you wait do I just would like to mention
that so um I just had a highlight on
here I got kind of excited last month
when we finalized a um letter of intent
with um L Rock CVB Little Rock Parks and
the PPA uh they're planning on um
hosting a pickle ball tournament here at
our resond tennis facility in
2025 I know a lot of people would say
well how is that possible it's not
pickle ball facility it's a tennis
facility they'll do a lot of uh
temporary lines on our existing
facilities and then we have to resurface
at least one or two Courts for the
actual TV presentation of it so um and
for the final games and whatnot and then
we will'll resurface it back to tennis
uh so just an effort by all of us to
really get another um event sport event
another economic boom um this this
coming year in 2025 it will be a little
bit smaller and has the opportunity to
grow into what they call a PP like a
open um which would be a bigger uh
tournament where it's like a weekl long
thing and I'd have to learn a lot more
about it but it sounds really exciting
um and so they're the reason they like
this is they like the market here but
they also like our facility uh I get
that all the time about resent tennis um
excellent facility we just need the
indoor aspect of it that's in the sales
tax and and we would have a a oneoff
awesome facility so anyway y I was going
to I was going to punt the new
commission ideas to to next month uh
maybe to have it in that new business
again just I just maybe think about some
new ideas that we could go on in 2025
whether you know we did a golf
tournament in 2023 for to raise money
for the parts Conservancy uh I think
this is just an open form general what
what can we do as a commission um but
let's I think just for the sake of time
we'll we'll we'll we'll punt that till
till next month so the agenda items for
next month I think it's would love to
have Joe dorsy give a presentation about
the the community centers and then the
new commission ideas continue to be in
new business is there anything else I
think just continue to work talk about
the sales tats and about you know any
letters that you uh that you might have
written or or want to write um
anything else for that want to be added
to the agenda next next month and can we
add um arks and Rec dashboard we don't
need to discuss it right now but just as
a bullet item to talk about possibly
putting together a dashboard report
dashboard for let's we won need to bog
this down with it but okay because I
have a brainstorm list okay well we'll
put that down as well and what about
changing the social media committee to
the marketing committee Mr chair that
would require an amendment to the
