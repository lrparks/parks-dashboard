that be fine thank you I think that this
has occurred last year this this
December meeting is usually
challenging

agenda items uh for the budget review
the budget for
2025 as I've commented before I
presented to the city manager and eoa uh
office um and so um and then I also have
presented to the city board and then
we've also had uh several discussions of
that
uh at the board level um after each
meeting in the last few meetings at the
board level and so um there still has
not been a final vote that will be my
understanding it will be the 17th of
December and um as of right now uh I
requested I was allowed five items to
request which was a new thing that the
CFO added this year um anyway with that
being said I took the priorities that we
had um some of the larger ones were the
senior facility that we're trying to
accomplish here next year if somebody
can mute that that would be
excellent thank you um anyway so the
biggest things that we did get on the
budget that are tentative right now are
some funds for the uh resumen Golf
Course we've always had a um a loss in
our operations there under merchandising
and
concessions uh we bring we have $50,000
that we start with um merchandise
and a little bit less than that for
concessions and then we uh expend that
throughout the year all the revenue goes
to the general fund anyway um we're not
able to um buy enough merchandise now to
make it through the whole year anyway so
with this new funding hopefully that's
all approved we'll be able to improve
that there so it's not as much as we
needed for the whole department but I'm
thankful to get something so um I do
have a budget document here um this is
the proposal here for the 2025 budget um
so there's lots of great questions I
don't know if that's online do you know
Linda Linda sent that via email to all
of us and it it should be online as well
okay but anyway so if there's any
questions on the budget for 2025 I'd be
happy to uh discuss those as
well any questions
there it's going to be pretty pretty
flat revenue from 2024 to 2025 is what
they're expecting my understanding is
that yes it's pretty flat um the CFO has
commented that the sales tax I guess is
kind of flatten off throughout the third
fourth quarter of the year um but he was
able to um everybody was able to uh
submit a balanced budget to the board so
um that's great you know that's really
good for the our city to be able to have
a balanced budget I mean obviously we
have to to do that but in terms of
having enough Revenue to achieve that
and move forward so um anyway I'm
excited to see what the last um you know
make sure there's no changes and then
happy to do a a bigger report on our you
know budget for
2025 um in regards to the full budget
and and goals for that um potentially in
January if that's if that's
needed okay well without any other
questions I would like to um recognize
uh Beth Carpenter our City attorney um
as many of you are aware she's uh been
our City attorney for many years I don't
know how long Beth you been here at the
commission for a while she's been at the
city for over 30 years and she's
retiring officially this year I hear her
last day is Friday um it's the 20th next
next next Friday okay so we get one more
good week so and um anyway so I just
wanted to recognize you and I have a um
a plaque here from the commission and
from us that we'd like to present to you
um it it states uh congratulations your
vision and dedication have changed the
city for the better your shoes will not
be easily filled so I want to present
this to
you thank you so much
thank you so much oh wow thank you don't
know what to say
um oh that goes
with well it it's certainly been my
pleasure um serving the the Parks
Commission in the city of Little Rock
and I've enjoyed every minute of it um
and I'm going to miss
everyone um it I've been with commission
I I can't even remember how many years
but it's been a while so uh thank you so
much and and you're in very good hands
with with Simone black and she'll be at
the next meeting and again i' certainly
appreciate all of the love and and I
love you guys as well thank you so much
thank
you thank you Beth for your service and
we wish you well in retirement if you
get bored on Wednesdays at noon you can
always come and come hang out for always
come up and do citizen communication
There You Go There You Go leag On th
ball yes thanks for reminding
me all right um can I oh yeah sorry I
have a quick question Leen on the budget
um i' looked at the revenue side just
for the general city and I was going to
ask earlier at the master plan committee
is just something that caught my eye
golf they're showing going up I mean a
fair amount
180,000 and then Fitness and Aquatics is
going up
180 the Fitness and Aquatic maybe makes
sense since there was like the pool and
everything was sort of shut down last
year but is the golf what's driving or
the expectation that's driving the
revenue uh just what's driving the
revenue at golf um I'm still surprised a
little bit that it's still doing as well
as it has but it really uh took off um I
think it's a little bit of the the loss
of the two courses in in Little Rock so
we pushed everything down to to resond
so I can't really speak to I wasn't
studying the budgets in terms of like
what the bigger numbers look like when
we had four courses but now that we're
down to two um but I do know that um
when I became director the golf was
doing really well and it and has
continued to do really well or at least
resond has um and I I I would say a lot
of that's because of the other ones
being closed um had a lot to do with
covid I believe as well um I do I am
worried about our future there in terms
of our maintenance and ability to keep
the golf course uh at the standards that
we need to keep it um I'm working on
hopefully getting some bond funds since
we don't have sales tax dollars for that
for some improvements there our budgets
there are challenging in terms of the
cost of goods and Fleet and and
everything else and that's a whole
another subject but um yeah that's a
good note and I guess Jim Daly uh the
biggest thing there is that we I'm
assuming we we lost some right because
we had a closure of the indoor
facilities we've been able to pick some
of that back up we've been doing some
other improvements there as well and
trying to work really well with an
Advisory Group that's been established
there so hopefully all those things have
helped thank you
then so before we move on I'd like to
recognize uh Britney she has some events
um to discuss I'd also would you like me
to share your
news I'd after
or
anticipation we'll start with events

Britney thank you
Britney thank you that all that you have
done and I know that social media
marketing has really
gone up another level with you here so
we'll miss you but I'm sure you'll do
great things at at metrop plan so um
Courtney do you want to talk about
safety in this non- meeting we're
having
okay good afternoon Courtney Perry
safety training coordinator
Parks
mahog hook me up
just waiting for a second for the slides
that's all just so you know there are
every month um Courtney as well as the
other directors do do post a a doc
report of their of their area and
Courtney always has a report about um
safety and training every in your
packets every
month all right thank you um can you go
back to the first slide there's one
slide before this
one so been at this um for for a little
while um started this job 2017 and uh
hit the ground running um pretty much my
first priority was going out to each and
every Park and seeing what the safety
safety Health was um kind of seeing what
the what the hazards were that we're
dealing with um today this is what we
have this uh this list that you see
right here on your screen can you go
down from check check down
go
down um the the three rows um represent
uh what we have is the um number of
Hazards um to date which
is8 I think is what that number says um
the Orange is line there um is work work
request that has been generated as a
result of that and then um the line to
to the to the left is um the number
that's been addressed our maintenance
system or contractors
um to to get that stuff up to speed
next uh what we're looking at here is
pretty much just the the profile view um
of of the same same data
um go back just a
total um total accomplished um total
that's been through the
maintenance um system and then what
what remains outstanding so um to date
we've got um of the of the 2008 we've
got 80 84% that's been naturally
rectified either through our maintenance
or through contractors um which leaves
about um 160% left which is about 167 I
think
next so each and every Hazard goes
through a logical process of safety risk
management right so what we're looking
at here a logical um Matrix uh risk
assessment um based on probability um or
frequency over time as well as um
severity um how how
bad the manifestation of a hazard could
actually be if if it was to actually
happen all right so um this is this ISS
this is the Matrix that's that's used to
assess each which also helps to
prioritize um as you all know
resources are limited so we need to to
prioritize um and address those that are
worst um and then next
Etc um
red um skip skip to the next Slide
m I'll explain that in the next
slide so um once the risk assessment is
done um they are put in what's called
these risk risk categories all right um
which which which has the risk
assessment
numbers um as well as all the parks that
are associated with you with with with
each so basically um parks that fall in
red pretty much
um not best condition um might even
consider removing those um charer the
yellow or the um orangish type of a
color there
um are parks
that will be um somewhat coste effective
like we can put some money into it to
bring them up to speed up to standard
and um basically um all the parks that
fall into the green category
are they're either brand new because
they were newly installed or they
are we're really doing pretty good as
far as um their overall condition you
can you can kind of scroll down
now you see some percentages to the
right of those I'll address that next
slide so um that's basically the same
information but kind of simplified a
little bit well each when I when I go
out and and assess these Parks they are
not just willy-nilly or out of the air
they are put against the standards the
the ASM standards for playgrounds uh as
well as cpsc right so the percentages
that you see reflected there in the last
column um it's it's uh graduated can you
can you go up top and then just kind of
scroll down I graduated from Green all
the way down to Red you you could also
read it from Red all the way up but um
again it's the same idea um the group of
parks that that uh that fall in green
are in overall good condition or they're
brand new newly installed like B Panky
Etc um scroll
down and you can kind of see how the
associated scores scores
fall fall into those pars that are in
red um once again this this slide
includes parks that have actually been
removed as a result in large part as a
result of the safety program identifying
these parts as needing to be removed
right
um the arrests that are on there that um
have not been removed yet they're in the
works and where
figuring it out all right but uh
basically the same concept as the last
slide as the um as you see them col
color coded right there the ones that
are in the yellow and orange um we can
invest in them to improve them and and
they'll be safe enough to actually use
out there
so yes ask a quick question on that so
is the breakout between green and yellow
and orange and red is it simply
the the compliance rate so if it's 90 or
above it's green and yeah right within
that 90 even if they have like one and
it's a critical issue it would still
show his green on there yeah so um
it's it's overall all right so um if for
those that might be 90 for example
um out of all the items that are checked
good or in compliance with the standards
there might be one or two that needs to
be addressed right say a bolt or
something regardless of the severity of
those one or two that right is
that say again regardless of the
severity of those one or two whether
it's a a low risk or a high risk if it's
open um right
um if
if the severity um is assessed as a high
priority that's something that we jump
on pretty quickly right so we move um
through the maintenance process to get
that rectified okay yeah thank you like
to clarify there too is that if if
there's something that there's a we're
certified Perry myself and some others
are certified as a a playground safety
inspector and so there's a ranking and
there's a priority Hazard which he
factors into this
right so just to clarify on your
question I just want to make sure that
if if there's a priority One hazard out
there we immediately shut down the
playground and immediately address it so
it wouldn't be in the green it would
immediately go to the red so um and then
that that's you that's why Perry's here
and so we would address it that way so
not you know if it depends on how high
the severity is but just one item like
there's a a bolt missing or something on
a component and there's you know it's
not listed as a priority One Hazard then
it might be a 93% or something just to
help clarify that but Justin you have
something to add to
that of the issues
right right
um can you go back just just a couple of
slides um back to the Matrix um MOG
please just and just to pick it back on
what Lan was saying um like this you can
see the codes that that uh that
correspond to to each section it's it's
it is small but um um you can see the
codes there um go back go back one more
slide and those codes are based on one
more slide back based on how we use this
Matrix right here so um for example um
if we determined
uh that a hazard um is occasional will
happen um only occasionally at a
moderate severity then it's a it crosses
to a three
three uh C which is a a medium that the
m means medium the H is high the red is
is extremely high which is bad and the
green is is you know of course good so
just wrap this up too I'd like to share
is that we as staff there's a certain
group of us operations that meet every
two weeks to review certain things like
this this list that's how we go through
this list this list also helps us
understand what needs to be replaced
what needs to be removed um as funding
will allow or not allow also Perry um
this is not the only asset that he has
this kind of detailed information we he
he reviews all different types of assets
to um they're not all to this level but
a lot of them like light poles or or
community centers in in terms of that
and he takes all the public requests as
well so if somebody brings a request to
our attention that there's a safety
concern cuz Perry is one guy trying to
cover 6,000 acres is challenging so we
encourage our staff to look into all
these as well um but anyway that's just
a little tidbit of uh Perry's work I
appreciate your presentation all right
any more
questions thank you all right
thanks you'll see on the you'll see on
the agenda there's a lot of items in Old
business
um does anyone have any just comments or
discussions on that before we move to
the new business and I'm assuming the
new business will be news new business
for next month okay
um any any questions or comments on
unfinished unfinished business I have
one question before we before Beth goes
away um on the membership I know we have
some vacancies coming up in
January in the bylaws it it says that
the
commission should fill those
appointments how does that process work
or how work the bylaws imply that we
should kind of nomin the bylaws need to
be amended to reflect what currently is
is happening the bylaws are incorrect
and that would be on Simone's plate for
the first of the year to get to get
sorted out bless you um selections
there's a process and Leland knows about
this as well um for uh to fill positions
on City boards and commissions and
that's through the city clerk's
office and um I believe that the
director would turn in the vacancies to
to the clerk's office the clerk would
post the position um and fill the
positions accordingly uh they would need
to be um approved by the City Board of
Directors so there is a process that we
have to go through fill board and
commission positions and that's to the
city clerk's
office and again the bylaws Parks
Commission bylaws are not correct at
this time on that thank
you okay
um if you if you're still on Old bit or
unfinished business um we've tried to
cover this every time and even though
Britany is not going to be here next
year um there are the still the the pars
newsletter and so if there's anything
that anybody would like to add um from
the discussion or previous discussions
that Brittney could take note of uh
things that would maybe meet the uh goal
to meet the newsletter um that's always
on here to discuss and
um does anybody have anything that they
would like to
add yeah would I would uh recommend
something to the effect of uh sort of
the accomplishments of
the not necessarily just Courtney but
really the whole
team um on like the percentage if it's
86% I think was the number off top of my
head I don't have that note in front of
me but um
84% uh of the items identified have been
sort of cleared in the last X period of
time uh
and that that you all take suggestions
like if someone sees something at a park
you know what's the process is it a you
know call 311 as it email you guys I
mean just sort of what that is because
the more eyes that are out there that
know they can give feedback the better I
think it yeah well it's just for for
Britney for the
newsletter so um it's important to
involve um pretty much every employee in
parks in the process um because the
people who know their environment the
most are the people who work there so
they know where things are right and
that they also know when things aren't
aren't right right so that's an
opportunity for them to report the
hazards that they find in their area so
in order to make that happen um what
I've done is create like a hazard report
form that everyone has on their phone um
so that when they're in their work
environment anything that they find as a
hazard okay they take a picture of of it
um complete a form and then send it to
me and I'll get it going through the
through the SRM process um I have been
trying to make that more sophisticated
but working through
311 we've we've had some snags in the in
the process but it's something that we
working up behind the scenes um you
know how to really improve that process
and make it more
sophisticated but um it's it does does
work gets everyone involved in it
um thank you
yeah okay um there's nothing else I was
going to move to new business
um you know we can't vote on anything
but if there's any discussion about the
the two items and um on the extending
the parts commission time I wasn't here
last month is that
something um that we feel strongly about
as a commission
um you know I I was thinking about if we
want to this can to be discussed of
course it'll be discussed in January in
new business but um you know maybe we
start at 11:45 instead of noon
um but I'm open to if we think we really
need more than one hour um I was
thinking maybe it's send it 50 Maybe
start at 11:45 or end at
1:15 um just see how that goes but like
I said um we can talk more in January
about this or about the the marketing uh
the dashboard as well but just want to
open up for any communication Among
Us is that just to get it on our
calendar so that I mean if we get to
1:00 and we need more time we always
have the ability to extend meeting
yeah yeah I mean I think I mean it's I
think we all want to be out of here at a
at a timely manner but if if it's
something important I
mean we can always go over one um so
verely if we schedu it for an hour and a
half we will
always we should
yeah I would like to comment on that
so if if the goal is to understand that
I mean or the if if what you're saying
Mike is that if we have the need to go
over um I think it would be fair for
everybody we would need to discuss and
approve scheduling that because I often
or staff or I'm sure others schedule
appointments right after this right and
so I'd hate to say you know I don't I
you know I think we just need to narrow
it down so that would be my
recommendation only though yeah I think
it should be scheduled um just for to
work around A1 schedules um so
can we add agenda items to the new
business this is our non- meetings okay
probably not well I know we we I know
Leland and and his team want to do a
kind of 2024 year in review um as as
well as a
2025 preview um so hopefully that can if
if Leland as a Park's director wants to
put something on the agenda that's his
prerogative for the next meeting okay
okay I would just uh I know we get busy
with the holidays but you know if
they're commission members I mean it
figure out what kind of what you guys
want to
do um 2025 kind of what what are your
sary goals both on the commission as
well as um the staff at at the parts but
I know we've had a great year in 2024
besides the sales stats I think you guys
have done a lot uh on on the parts and
uh I want Leland to highlight that in
January and then in February we can talk
more about kind of the preview of 2025
and what that looks like um anyone have
any comments suggestions about
that and we can talk about the budget as
well um once once that's voted and
approved on hopefully before uh before
the
holidays just to clarify uh Ben are you
suggesting that in in January
the parks department present on our
accomplishments and and our completion
of projects or have highlights for
2024 yes and then and then with their in
that same time frame present our goals
and vision for 2025 or would you for the
February for the February
okay also just to clarify we can
schedule the meetings for an hour and 15
minutes or an hour and a half and end
early so if we don't use the full-time
feel free to end we don't have yeah okay
thank
you is there anything that you feel like
would like to be discussed next month in
January or any presentations that you
want to see I mean just be thinking
about for the year what you want to see
from presentations or what goals you
want to accomplish and hope we can get
back together in January and refresh and
and have some ideas for 2025 and
goals hey
Britney I did want to speak to that uh
Hub um the information Hub the dashboard
yeah mahogany is going to pull up the
website real quick cool um this does not
exist yet but it will exist before I
leave and so I wanted to show you'all
where you will find
it uh um so one thing I would say is um
it's essentially just going to be a page
uh that's built on a three three column
grid um so here's our homepage Mogan if
you scroll all the way down to the
bottom of the
page so if you scroll up a little bit
this section of the website is called
the large promos um on the back end so
we right now we highlight our leadership
so you see that great picture of Leland
right there where you can click and read
about him and some of our other leaders
below that is our master plan so I'm
going to build another box right there
that will be um Parks dashboard and a
little quip about telling people what
they might find on that page essentially
an information page for all things Park
so just know that you'll be able to go
to the homepage scroll down to the
bottom and look for that Hub button
right here with our master plan and
Leadership and we're going to have just
essentially a link Master links to our
master plan strategic plan the visions
that you saw from the sales tax um a
link to the commission a link to the
Conservancy job opportunities leadership
budget accomplishments goals performance
measures Maps Online requests uh linking
to social media reading the latest news
and viewing past presentations so that
is my stab at the information hub
news what did you call it latest in news
yeah like the so there is a button at
the top of the page called Parks news
and that's where I'm publishing these
articles that we're writing would there
be anything showing like events upcoming

things like that I can add that there as
well so it's also a button at the top of
our web page that says events and that
is events specific to Parks and
Recreation that are um public facing

cool thank
you Lewis you have any comments for us
uh just some questions on some upcoming
dates I feel like someone text me with a
canis Park Grand Opening and
I I did that was um December 18th at
Britney is it
11:30 thank you and then do we have an
ETA for w I knew you were gonna ask that
so I'll give uh Justin an opportunity to
share his the latest challenges and
updates for that that finalization of
that project
um so Kanas has been you know it's the
the final of our three uh park
playground kind of bond projects so it's
it's been a lot of fun uh but being kind
of the last on the end had some unique
challenges as far as with supply chain
things and uh factories we found out
after we ordered like picnic tables and
some things like that uh got a message
that those are going to probably be
delayed and may not even be in until
January because they shut the factory
down in Minnesota for the month of
December in January for updating all
their stuff and all that so after
stuff's ordered so um and then with
getting the lights in so it's probably
realistically we're looking at probably
early February before all the final the
playground and the walking trails done
we have some components of it that are
done um and it looks really nice um
that'll be usable but just before kind
of the icings on the final things may
may be a little bit before we get the
security lighting and cameras and all
can you clarify what has been
accomplished today at kuis and are those
things usable or are we yes and I've
been in contact with some of the
neighborhood and citizens us so the the
walking trail um is completed um and can
been completely uh repaved and so
citizens are using that and walking
around the lake and the playground is
also uh complete at this time and they
finished that in the turf uh there is
some grading issues between that that
we're trying to solve some drainage
stuff uh and that's been a challenge you
know this time of year with with water
issues but it that those those aspects
are usable and we just have some like I
say some fine-tune and stuff we just
need weather and shipping to to
cooperate with us thank
you all right well thank you all if
there's nothing else um just going to go
and end I was we had a
a so Quinton just logged on and so um
does that establish a quorum if you want
how many do we how many do been here for
like half the meeting I just can't get
my camera to work so I'm sorry if in
order to be in order to be counted
President we have to see see you as well
as hear you let me try to do it from my
phone how many Commissioners do we have
currently in in the room we have
Quinton that would make sense five six
if Quinton
if he can get his video working I can't
I feel okay let me let me keep trying
here
um yeah we're we're done with the
meeting so I don't I think we could the
master plan committee met subcommittee
met last at after last meeting um and we
were going to meet prior to this one but
then I guess three of the folks weren't
there or not able to come but um we were
looking at the differences on the the
master plan from 2020 the Strategic plan
and then there's sub plans at the
various I guess significant park
locations and uh sort of trying to get
our hands wrapped around that a little
bit and then as well uh there's some
discussions around the the budget
process
being what we're charged with as a
commission versus sort of it's occurring
and and how we need to sort of Rectify
that or change language or whatever we
need to do so um anyway we will be
meeting probably before the next uh
January meeting as well like prior to uh
but we'll have to schedule that
so yeah uh Canon if you could work with
mahogany to get that scheduled so we
can
