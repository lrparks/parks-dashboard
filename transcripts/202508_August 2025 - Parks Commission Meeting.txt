>> Yes, he did. Well, he sent he hasn't
sent a resign. Well, he sent a question.
We haven't confirmed that.
>> Okay. and we haven't gone through the
process of saying that you're officially
not a part of the commission.
>> I just wanted to confirm to make sure
that didn't change our quorum number.
So, okay. Thank you.
>> City Director Andrea Lewis
>> present.
Currently, we have four commissioners
present.
Um, that's short of a quorum.
>> Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you so
much. we will move forward with some of
the activities that we can without
having a quorum. So, let's go to citizen
communication. Is there any citizens in
the
crowd that would like to communicate
with us?
Seeing none at this time, we'll move on
to director's reports. Um, and we'll
start with director's report
number one.
>> Sure. Thank you. Um,
I'll just cover my board agenda items
real quick. Um, we recently took a
Reservoir Musco sport lights for the
ball field to be replaced at Reservoir
Park due to the tornado damage. Um, that
has been approved and staff's working on
uh final purchasing of those lights for
the uh new ball field to be constructed
as soon as possible. Uh, nothing is was
this week for the agenda for the board
to consider from parks. Um and then one
other item that was covered uh previous
with um before since we've haven't met
were the two sprayers for golf. There
are two new pieces of fleet equipment
for um first te and forman golf course.
Um the other reports that I'd like to
comment on is the 30 crossing project
the master plan for the 30 crossing park
which is the 18 acres in downtown Little
Rock. uh we will be ha hosting with our
consultants a um public um master
planning input session on September 20th
and September 21st. Uh we welcome all
people to come and give input. Uh those
time periods are at 4 to 6 on September
20th which would be located at the Uler
building on uh in the River Market
District. And then on 11 um on the 21st,
11 to 6 pm would be at the food truck
festival. The food truck festival this
year has been relocated to the 30
crossing location on Second Street and
in all the green space of this uh
proposed park area and so we'll be
having a large a uh display for public
input and um gathering all different
opinions and requests for the project.
So please come participate in that.
We'll be sharing more information on our
social media page and everywhere else uh
in terms of those dates and we recently
hosted a press conference with the
downtown partnership which um is hosting
the actual food truck festival. Um so
those are the biggest uh updates I have.
There's many other things that some
other staff will be reporting on today.
Um does anybody have any questions about
the staff reports?
Do do they have a number on how much the
interstate park would cost? I know they
keep saying this like 2.5 for the just
the study, you know, or just the plan to
draw it up.
>> Right. So, just to be clear, what was
>> Director Parks? If you could speak a
little louder into the mic, I don't
think it's picking you up.
>> Yeah, it's not picking you up.
>> Thank you. So, just to be clear, what
was presented last night at the board um
was the actual park deck, which is over
the interstate, which is completely
different than the project I was just
referencing. So, the project I'm
referencing that is in the parks
department is the 30 crossing park,
which is the big green space along
Second, Third Street, Fourth Street in
downtown Little Rock. Uh the park deck
is a project that has uh been presented
to the board by the uh public works
department as a um um they received a
grant for a feasibility study, a
planning study for the actual um study
of the infrastructure that would be
needed to to span over an interstate uh
for such a type development.
>> So you're talking about where they're
having the food truck uh festival. Uh
the food truck festival would actually
be is is in this year is in the 30
crossing location, right? The same one
you're talking about. Yeah. Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So the food truck festival,
the public input, all that all that is
what I was mentioning is all in the uh
30 crossing area which is in the green
space that was just completed because of
the 30 crossing pro construction
project, the expansion of the
interstate.
>> Okay.
>> What streets?
>> Second.
>> Uh second street runs right through it.
It's um and then there's third and
there's fourth on
it's it's multiple blocks. It's um
>> Sherman Street is running north to south
on it. I believe Collins is the farthest
uh eastern and sec and then there's
Cumberland which is the farthest west.
>> If you'd like I mean that could be
something there's been a lot of
discussion on this project. I'd be happy
to give a presentation next month to
give a lot of clarity on the project.
>> I'm ask because I got a question about
it and when it was a text I haven't
responded yet, but I was thinking the
park deck and now hearing you say the 30
crossing park. So,
>> correct. So that's what I was trying to
clarify myself and sorry if I didn't do
that well but the deck park is a
completely separate project that has
been
more or less outside of the parks
department. It's a public
infrastructure. It's a public uh public
works department request to the board.
Um and so um I've been involved in that
very little on the on the selection side
of things. Um, but what we've been
heavily involved in and what we've been
really been focused on is the 30
crossing part.
>> Gotcha. Okay. Thank you.
>> Y,
>> welcome, Ben.
>> Sorry, Mike. Do you want to
go back and approve the July meeting
minutes?
>> First, let's go ahead and take notice of
the new members and establish that we
have a quorum. Let's get that on the
record. Um,
>> uh, Commissioner, well, Commissioner Ben
France
>> here,
>> Commissioner Summer Campbell
>> here.
>> Um, so six commissioners are now
present.
>> So, we now have a quorum.
>> We have a quorum.
>> So, can we have a motion to approve the
July meeting minutes? I have a
correction to the minutes, just a minor,
but on the
uh on the on the staff reports bullets,
it it says that I had asked for a
dashboard
update, but it's actually features
directory. So, if we can get that
corrected since we're that's something
that um we were going to keep going
along here on
it's on the second pa or the first page
down under staff reports first bullet.
Commissioner Bernardo requested a parks
dashboard update should be Commissioner
Bernardo requested a parks features
update.
>> Okay. Um just a question real quick
about that. We've discussed that in the
past uh when uh uh with the previous uh
media marketing uh coordinator and at
that time it was referred to as a
dashboard. So are you checking
>> No, there's two different things. One
was a dashboard which the other
commissioners didn't seem that
interested in
>> and then the the other one is a features
which is one that's going to say you
know soccer fields at these parks,
trails, you know, whatever. But it's
going to be a a long and Graham was
going to help work on that. Um, so it's
an ongoing item to see if we can get a a
directory that that a resident could go
out and say, "I'm interested in, you
know, um, Frisbee golf."
>> Okay.
>> Where is that at in in Little Rock?
>> Okay. I just want Okay. I just wanted to
make note because that'd be something
different,
>> right? That's why I'm making that
distinction.
>> Thank you.
So, I'll make a motion to accept the
meeting minute approve the meeting July
meeting minutes as amended.
>> I'll second that motion.
>> All in favor?
>> I
>> I
>> All opposed.
And now I want to make a motion to
approve the July meeting minutes.
Have a motion.
>> I'll second that motion.
All in favor say I.
>> I.
>> I.
>> Okay.
Um Leland went through some board. Did
you go through your report and Okay.
>> Uh yes. I I went through my um staff
reports or I went through my director's
report. There was no question on staff
reports. Just making sure there's
>> I had just one question on the
operations staff report where it shows
budget items. Is it is our budget um
fiscal year through December?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. So like on OP where is it? Park
maintenance says we've only got 30% of
the funds left. Is that a concern?
>> I'll let Justin speak to that. But is
that operation maintenance and under
maintenance? We have two different
maintenance accounts. So we have some
building and land maintenance accounts
in different areas.
>> Yeah, that's under the uh mowing
account, the operations for mowing and
all that. And so we do have 30% of that,
but
it is going to be a little bit tight,
but typically the majority of our funds
are spent in the summer in these months.
So it typically spending trails off
significantly in the fall in those
accounts. So, uh, we are monitoring it
and watching those.
>> Okay. Thanks.
>> Yeah, I would say um, during the spring
summer months, we have heavy growth and
so we rely a lot of, uh, on contract
help to catch us up. Um, and then in the
summer because of the heat index policy
of us in July, we missed 12 days that we
could work um, in terms of maintenance
in the parks. And so, we rely a lot on
um, contract labor. And so we spend a
lot of money in that. So yes, it's
concerning, but it's it's just where we
are with with regards to our budget.
>> Okay.
>> Great question.
>> Thank you.
>> Yep.
>> Anything else for the staff reports
before we get into events? Before we get
into events,
Aaron or Graham or Gabriel, do you have
anything to report on?
>> Hello. How are y'all?
All right, National Public Lands Day is
approaching once again. This is our fall
cleanup event and it's always one park.
National Public Lands Day is the single
largest volunteer day event on public
lands and we've plugged into it about
eight years ago is when we started this.
So, it's September 27th. It's always the
fourth Saturday of September. It's in
Heman Park from 9:00 am to 11:30 a.m.
And we are going to weed eat, uh, pick
up down limbs, paint benches, pick up
litter, basically a good oldfashioned
park cleanup. And we also have some
prizes to raffle away. We are raffling
off uh, three pairs of loppers. So, I
hope that y'all will come out and join
us. Um, y'all have the little card in
front of y'all as well as I will also
send y'all a copy via email. So, please
share that with your people on social
media.
Any questions?
Oh, we're having lunch.
All right. Hope to see y'all there.
>> Hello. Um, I have one thing that's sort
of a recreation event, but I wanted to
share it with y'all. There's the Battle
Under 6:30 3v3 basketball tournament is
coming up. It's on September 13th at
Kanis Park. Um, it'll be a family
focused event. We'll have um bounce
houses and food trucks and things. So,
even if you're not going to play
basketball or don't know anyone that
plays basketball, you can come out and
enjoy the park.
>> What's the date on that?
>> September 13th.
What's the time?
>> 8 a.m.
>> 8 till
Gotcha. I was happy to see that.
>> Yes. And good to hear that it's extra
activities going on because I was
thinking it was just a tournament, too.
>> Okay.
And I'd like to share if if director uh
Lewis if you could help us um advertise
that, promote that, particularly with uh
director Phillips um and encouraging
people to participate in it. This is a
uh very beginning with our recreation
staff. Shawanda's back there being very
quiet, but she's worked really hard to
get this established with uh Graham and
many others. But um we're she's
partnering or the department is
partnering with um an outsider to help
us. Uh but we just want to make sure we
can get as many people u being the first
one, first year, first new location, all
the things new. Um you know, we want to
make sure we get some good uh um user
groups to come and participate. So
>> I saw it on Instagram. Can y'all email
me the actual graphics?
>> Yes, I can email it, too.
>> Thanks. Can you email graphic sign up
information? Age groups, all of it.
>> Say that again. Sorry.
>> Graphics sign up like the age groups.
>> Yes,
>> all of it. That would be great.
>> And then uh we were also Revzman Golf
Course and Two Rivers Park were
nominated for um best of the best in the
Arkansas Democrat Gazette. Um so voting
is going on now through August 24th. So
spread the word or go yourself and vote.
Um, we'd love for those two parks to
win. And that's all I have. Any
questions?
>> Uh, going back to the threeon-ree
tournament, is that going to be like the
old hoop fest? Is it similar to that?
You remember that?
>> I mean, that was so much fun. I used to
play in that. Yeah, I used to play.
>> You play too? Yeah. Yeah. Is that what
you were talking about, Director Lewis,
when you were talking about the
different ages and or was that you
talking No,
>> about that. That was that was me because
I play in the hoop, too. I was just
curious. Might play in this. We'll see.
So, so is that kind of what the style
is?
>> People ages. You got old people ages?
>> Yes.
>> Yeah.
>> What is old?
>> Almost 40.
>> Oh,
>> it's for ages 18 and up.
>> 18 and up. Okay.
>> Okay.
>> No, that's a great idea. Thank you for
that information.
>> Sorry, Ben.
>> Any other questions?
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you, Graham.
>> Uh before
>> raise my hand. I'm trying to raise my
hand, but I've been silent.
>> You can just yell at me.
>> I think everybody's on.
>> Oh. Oh, no wonder I can't do Okay. Very
because I know I'm not down till the
bottom, but because these are events, I
would like to just talk about a couple.
Uh one is this Saturday. It's a adopt a
highway. Uh Saturday the 16th. is the
Thrasher Boys and Girls Club from 8:30
to 11:30. Just pick it up. Here I am,
Brandon. Pick it up. Uh the other big
one is September 13th. I hope some of
you can show up. This is an annual
event. Uh Keep Little Rock Beautiful.
It's sponsored by Keep Arkansas
Beautiful, and we partner with parks.
We're at Murray Park every year. We had
a couple hundred people last year
picking up trash and litter. That's the
13th. There'll be a lot more about that
at Murray Park. And then finally, now
that it's back to school and uh some
students need volunteer hours, and this
is of course trash related, uh there are
free litter pits at all of Cal's
branches and kids, families, students
can go and check these out, do their
litter pickup, and turn them back in and
get credit on volunteer hours.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you.
Okay. Uh before we uh get into
presentations, we have a new
commissioner here, Christopher Kemp. Uh
I don't know if you want to tell a
little about yourself and
All right. Well, name's Chris Kemp. I'm
here, born and raised here in Little
Rock. I currently work for the state
over in the securities department. I'm
in the enforcement division, so
primarily deal with fraud and that kind
of thing. Um, but uh known Leland and
Ben for a long time and uh happy to be
here for sure.
>> Awesome. I appreciate you spending your
your Wednesdays with us and and uh
yeah, appreciate you you volunteering.
So,
>> I have a question for for Chris. I put
you on the spot. So, if you could share,
you didn't share um share anything that
you know about Little Rock Parks and
Recreation in terms of maybe your what
you know what parks you frequent or like
to use or do you use or any recreation?
I hate I hate to just ask you on the
spot, but anyway,
>> uh I primarily use Murray Park and uh
the Resmond Park Golf Course. Love the
Resmond Park Golf Course. Um it's uh you
know that golf course for some that may
not know um it's it's got one of the
most unique design challenges of pretty
much anywhere in the country in that it
will go underwater
but uh nevertheless when it does it
always comes back um Augusta green. So
I'm I'm always a big fan of that and
they do a wonderful job down there um
given some of the restraint constraints
that they have. But uh but yeah,
primarily uh in in that area and then I
use some of the state parks as well. Um
you know, Lake Catherine and then uh
Pinnacle probably mostly.
>> All right. Thank you.
>> Thanks, Chris. Okay. I think we have a
presentation from Justin about section
13.
I think you should have gotten some
powerpoints in your packets. Um
>> Okay. Good afternoon. uh appreciate the
opportunity and the time. Uh just going
to be be fairly brief. This is kind of a
highle overview. Just kind of a
presentation of uh not the official
report, but a presentation of what's
we're looking into and options that
we're exploring. Just kind of some
history and general information about
section 13 for those of you that may um
not know it.
>> Just point of clarification, can we talk
can you discuss why we're talking about
section 13? Just what is section 13? Why
do we care about section 13 today?
>> Yes. As far as with the
>> what's the whole purpose of this
>> like Yes. So you should have all
received ordinance 20 183 which is the
the disposition and we are currently
looking um at options of of disposing of
that property. And uh in accordance with
that uh there are some things that we
need to do and to to check on an
official report that will be uh
forthcoming later. just wanted to get
before you now um and kind of give you a
high level of what it is, where it is um
some of the challenges that have been
there and all that now just so that we
can kind of get that before you um
answer any questions that you may have
at this point um in in the game. So we
are looking at this uh kind of brought
this all about is just it's uh its
distance and its remote um location uh
has become unusable and unsustainable as
far as recreation to the citizens of
Little Rock. Um and some of this
verbiage that you see in this uh comes
directly out of that ordinance and then
also in the bottom of our mission
statement. Um so we we struggle with
being able to provide those quality
recreation opportunities um because of
some of these challenges. So, uh, if
you'll go to the next slide, we'll kind
of discuss where it is for those of you
that may not know. Um, section 13 is,
uh, almost a whole section of property.
It's about 619 acres out Garrison Road.
Um, it's it's not inside the city limits
of Little Rock. Um, you can see there on
a map, uh, you go out Highway 10, um, a
pretty fair bit. And if you look at the
next one, the map may explain it a
little bit better. Um it's outside the
pink there, that's W five. Um and the
city limits of Little Rock. And then the
green square up in the corner, that is
uh section 13.
Um so that's that's the the property
that that we're discussing uh as we're
looking through this. Some of the
challenges that we have with this
property um is because it's so remote
out there. Um you can leave it back on
the map if you want for just just a
little bit, but uh please. Yeah, thank
you. um because it's so remote. Um when
we acquired the property in 2001, uh
then later we built soccer fields,
playgrounds, and had some other
amenities out there. But because it's so
remote, it kind of led to uh a lot of
vandalism, a lot of uh term them
unsanctioned uh events and activities
that that occurred out there on a
regular basis. Uh it's very remote in
that it took our staff, it's 45 minute
drive from the nearest shop. So for us
to get out there to constantly respond
to ruts when people would get off and go
mudding and do donuts in the soccer
fields, it just it it took a long time
and was a lot of work for us to
constantly keep that up. Um and to
provide that kind of quality recreation
uh for the citizens that wanted to go
out and utilize the soccer fields or
have games. Uh we would just it was just
a constant problem of the day of or the
morning of like it was just a disaster
in that area. Uh the playground
vandalized all the time. It was spray
painted, burned, shot constantly. It'd
be bullet holes in the playground and
things like that from people just out um
enjoying some very rural county property
um out there. So, uh due to kind of all
those issues, uh it has been uh kind of
abandoned for lack of a better term as
far as us for maintenance. The soccer
fields are no longer maintained. Um and
we removed the playground and
reallocated that. So, if you'll skip
ahead, I have a brief timeline just to
give you some understanding um here. So,
we purchased and acquired or acquired
the uh property from Delta Timber back
in 2001
is when the property became ours. Uh
then later the uh it was developed and
it went to the board and there was a
resolution passed for us to use bond
funds of about a million dollars to uh
develop soccer fields or soccer field
playground uh some other site amenities
out there. There was a really nice
entrance sign and it was it was a nice
park. It really was nice. Um and that
rolled that way for about a decade. We
struggled with maintenance. We struggled
with upkeep. Um and then use because of
its distance and location of being so
far removed. Uh we weren't seeing the
use. And so those those items in
combination, the the lack of public use
and uh being so remote is kind of what
led to a lot of the issues that that we
have. which kind of brings us to this
discussion of possible um u disposition
of that property.
Um the next couple things on your your
packet are just some some samples of uh
some of the deeds and dates just for
your information. Again, this is uh the
the warranty deed where we acquired it
from Delta Timber back in 2001.
uh the next legal document and all these
legal documents right now currently with
the city attorney's office being uh
reviewed and we will have some some more
of that information finalized before the
official report um uh next time. But
there is a first writer refusal
agreement that is in place on that
property uh that looks like it has a
50-year clause with Deltic Timber. Um so
we'll be we'll be addressing that as we
move forward as well.
Um, and then just a copy of the
resolution for your information uh to
see that those funds and the million
dollars uh that come out of bond funding
uh that was spent in that. But again,
since then about 2016 is when the
playground and the amenities due to
increased vandalism, we we were able to
salvage what we could and re relocated
that playground and relocated the
amenities that still could be salvaged
um and reallocated them to other parks
uh for their use. So um and lastly we
have the ordinance uh 2183 which goes
through all the requirements that we
need uh to go through this process. And
it's it's a a lengthy process but just a
lot of check boxes. So this is kind of
the first highle uh uh presentation to
put before y'all before we come up with
an official report that outlines um all
the bullet points that's covered in
section three. We'll have that. Um, so I
just wanted to get this before y'all and
ask if anybody had any questions uh on
section 13 as far as the when's
and the house and the history of it
before we come before y'all with the
official report.
>> So what's the point of selling it? Would
it be to I mean so you don't feel like
you have to maintain it? Doesn't sound
like you're maintaining it now. And then
um would we have to sell it back to
Deltic Timber for $10? Looks like that's
how much we paid for it.
>> Cut a million for it, right?
>> Cut a million.
>> Hm.
>> How much would you pay for it? A million
dollars.
>> There was that's that's what the the
>> It was a long time ago.
>> Yeah, it it was. And we're still looking
into some of that. There there was there
were some other deals. It's not there's
not like a deed that says we paid this
much for it that we've we've discovered
at this time. There were some um other
things going on at that. So, we're still
trying to look into that. But the the
main reason that right now we're wanting
to to look at getting rid of it is to
liquidate and and acquire some some
funding for the department for some
other uses as well as we are still
technically responsible for the
property. So there's a lot of now that
there's we're not maintaining it like as
a soccer field, but there's a lot of
illegal dumping and activities and we
get a lot of calls uh to go out there
and clean it up. So we're cleaning up
something that's uh not being utilized.
So it is still kind of a burden and a
strain when you have to spend two hours,
you know, every couple weeks going out
and falling off, you know, dump sites.
So
>> do we have a potential buyer?
>> We've not got that far at all yet? No,
sir.
>> We all engage like a commercial real
estate or real estate firm to help sell
it or just
>> Yeah, I believe that would be the I
believe that would be the process. I'm
not sure. I would have to double check,
but there's a specific ordinance on how
and state law also on how to sell parks
and so we would have to follow whatever
that is.
>> If I if I may, I like to jump in here
and and give some additional comments to
some of the commissioners uh questions.
Um, so the reason that this has been
brought to you is is is multiffold. Uh
Justin covered a lot of it in terms of
from his standpoint of the maintenance
and operation uh challenges of the
property, but it's also because we have
a policy that states if the land isn't
providing a quality of life asset or
quality of life uh purpose to the
residents of Little Rock, then we should
question that. And this is the advisory
board that should question that. And so
we're questioning that and saying here's
a piece of property that is valued at X.
Uh we have an old appraisal that states
that it's very valuable property. Is
there something that we could utilize
that funding for? Absolutely. The list
is, you know, endless in terms of what
that would be. Has that been completely
defined? No. Um how would it be defined?
I'm sure there's a a whole another
process um that we would happy to be
able to go through. But what we're doing
today is just starting the initial
conversation of the appetite for this
commission to discuss openly the
disposal of a piece of property that is,
you know, managed by the parks
department for the city of Little Rock.
Um, as a parks director there, this is
not something that I ever really want to
bring to the table. Um, in the light of
our uh, finance
side of things um, and the way that we
um, have challenges with our life cycle
expenses. Um, Mike already brought up
this earlier about our budget for
maintenance. I mean, we have a lot of
financial challenges and so for us just
to sit and and say, well, let's just
hold on to this for another time period
or something like that is the question
that we're we're asking. Um, and it's
something that we want to bring to the
table. We would have to have at some
point a public hearing. There's a lot of
other information if you go down through
the ordinance that we have to bring to
the table, but we wanted just to um
start the initial conversation here with
the commission and see what kind of
questions and response that you would
have.
>> Okay.
>> Thank you, Justin. I'm going to jump in
and add if you guys want to read 2183.
If you have questions, please feel free
to reach out to me. I'm happy to discuss
it with you. So that like just reach out
to me directly and staff is also
available if you have any questions as
we're going through this process.
>> So why is it a new new business then?
>> I'm gonna let Mahogany uh answer that.
is
>> I'm just curious.
>> I can answer.
>> Um Okay, go ahead.
>> Yeah, I mean the master plan committee
has been discussing different ways to
find funds to uh generate um you know
ways to do different capital projects or
maintenance projects uh many different
things. And so um I believe Mike brought
it up last last month to say that we
were going to start this process. And so
that's why it was added to new business
as a as an agenda item. Um, and as we're
going, this is not a day-to-day, I mean,
I've never done this process. So, we're
learning a lot from our um, city legal
team. In fact, they have to give us a
legal opinion. There's many the the way
that this was originally acquired in
2001 is not a simple like just simple
deed, simple cost, all these things. And
so, um, there's a lot of complications
to it. And so that's that's why it's on
new business and that's why again we're
discussing it. So
>> let let me jump in a little bit. So um
Justin just just while I'm thinking
about it on the uh slides your ordinance
pages you have the ordinance number
transposed. So just double check that.
Um so from a process perspective
right parks identifies a property that's
really not meeting any useful purpose
for the the mission of parks. They
identify that they bring it to the
master planning committee and we kind of
discuss it and decide whether we want to
bring it to the commission to propose
disposing of that property. So that's
the stage we're at right now. That
ordinance uh 2183, if you look at it,
outlines the entire process. So Justin
is going to
um enhance the presentation he gave us
today and he'll add all the items from
section three of that ordinance that say
here's all the things you need to
consider and and and identify if you
want to dispose some some property. And
then what I'm going to propose, and I
don't know if I'm going to do it in the
subcommittee section or the new business
section or if you want me to do it now,
but in any case, I'm going to propose
that we all lot some time for next
meeting for Justin to come back with
that enhanced staff report.
And then from that, this commission will
need to vote, do we want to proceed with
that? And if we do proceed with that,
there will be a public hearing that will
be um chaired by the commission chair or
the vice chair if you're absent. But in
any case, we need to run that public
meeting to get public input. And then
with that public input, we'll go back
into our commission phase and we'll vote
to decide if we want to have it
presented to the board of directors. And
then the board of directors can, you
know, decide that. And then once they
decide it, then it's back in Leland's
lap to, you know, figure out how to go
contract that out and and and get the
the proceeds. And then once um they did
sell that and and we're assuming that,
you know, Delta is not able to get it
back for $10 that it would be like fair
fair value, right? So, if we got that
money for the land at fair market value,
that would go back into parks and wreck
and then I'm sure there would be a ton
of discussion of what to do with those
funds.
>> Okay.
>> So, hope that helps.
>> I think we just continue that
conversation, new business if that's
worked with you, Mike.
>> Yeah, that's fine.
>> Okay.
>> And just for a point of clarification,
Commissioner Bernardo uh said public
that we needed to have an additional
public meeting. It's actually a public
hearing and I just want to make sure
that we're using the correct terms as
we're going forward because this is a
regular public meeting but we actually
have to have a public hearing which can
happen simultaneously.
>> You thought you had educated me but not
quite.
>> Thank you.
>> Okay, let's get into uh unfinished
business subcommittee reports. Uh master
plan. Do you want to just table that to
new business Mike? Any
>> Yeah, that's fine.
>> Um parks conservancy, do you have
anything?
>> No, no update.
>> Okay. And then uh with last week uh or
not last week, last month Quinton became
vice chair. So I think we're looking for
a new social media subcommittee chair.
Um
>> I think we changed the name to
marketing.
>> Oh, excuse me. Marketing.
>> Uh so sorry, marketing subcommittee. So
um I'm not sure who is all on market. Do
you know who's on the marketing besides
you or
>> I thought it was just me and Shamia and
then Quincy was on it but he's no longer
on the
>> um if I could uh just add one thing. Um
JT served as vice chair and chair of the
master plan subcommittee.
>> Okay.
>> So
just wanted to add that in there. Um if
you still wanted to stay engaged in that
position. Um vice chair.
>> Um if no one else wants to do it, I'll
stay engaged. But if anybody else wants
to to take the chair, uh, then they're
more than welcome to do that. So,
>> anyone else want to take chair? If not,
um, we'll have Quinton continue to do
it, but any volunteers to be
chair of the marketing subcommittee.
>> I Let me Can I make a comment?
>> Yeah. Well, just like to say I'd
advocate for um Graham and Gabby over
there who we're we're strongly
represented today in our social media
and marketing and data coordination. And
so um we'd really like to have somebody
from the commission. Not that Whiteside
hasn't done a great job, but since he's
taking on the additional role here, if
there's anybody that has any interest,
they they would definitely would love to
have the representation from the
commissioners. Um, that's just a little
ploy for them. So,
>> y'all are doing a great job. I'd
volunteer, but I don't think I count.
>> And do we have a list of who's on what
committees? Is there anybody that's not
on the committees? I mean, obviously
Christopher is new, but he doesn't
>> know what he's getting into yet, right?
>> Christopher, it's Christopher. Good.
Thanks for volunteering.
>> Volunte. Uh, just to answer your
question, Commissioner Bernardo, yes,
and we have sent them out in previous
communications, but we can resend them
again with new assignments and new um
>> I mean, do you remember is there is is
it is each commissioner assigned to at
least one committee?
>> Uh, yes.
>> Okay.
>> Well, I'll just maintain the marketing
chair at this time and then if somebody
wants to talk to me about it, I'm happy
to relinquish it at any time. So,
>> okay.
>> Okay.
>> Um,
I'm just looking at the unfin unfinished
business list. Um,
I think we, you know, I think we've
covered a lot of these already. I mean,
I don't know if we need to go through
each one. Um,
but you know, I think continue to, you
know, I forget every time, but if you
visit a park to submit a photo uh to
Graham, um, I do want to bring up that
one of the newer commissioners that was
selected had to resign because he had a
Wednesday night or Wednesday during the
day um, meeting. So, I think we do have
a a vacancy with that and with JT
leaving. Um, but does anyone have any
questions or comments about unfinished
business? I think we we've talked a lot
about these already. Um,
>> so we can remove the last two bullets,
right?
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Going forward.
>> Yeah.
>> Um, if I can make a comment about this
because there seems to be some questions
about unfinished business. um when we're
doing the agendas, when there's
something in new business um and we
cover it, it has to be referenced um as
unfinished business and then once you
move on from that um it's generally
removed. Um there have been a few items
that have been static
>> um that we left on there like
subcommittee reports and stuff and
whatnot, but um but yeah, so once you
guys uh speak on it and say we're going
to remove it, then it'll be removed off
unfinished business for the most part
except for those standard static issues.
>> Thanks.
>> Okay. I think
for for my purposes I think what needs
to remain on unfinished basis
subcommittee reports parts commission
vacancy appointment update and then
request for commissioners submit one
photo. I think those are and then I
think those are the three that probably
need to stay on there for next month.
Any questions on unfinished business
before we go to new business?
Okay. Um,
Commissioner Bernardo, do you have any
update on the dashboard?
>> So, that's my request and Graham to
update.
>> Graham.
>> Yeah. So, that there's no update at this
time. So, we're waiting on the city as a
whole to move forward with a new website
management system. And there's not any
update there.
>> And just for to be clear again, it's not
dashboard update. It should be features
park features update.
>> Can we make sure we change that next
next week? Next month.
>> Can I come? Um Graham, do you think it's
worthy to have somebody that you're
speaking to to come give an update on
the website or is or could you give us a
date next month or a more definition of
when the website or just so this
commission can understand? Mike keeps
asking about all these website
improvements and I want to make sure we
can give him a definite answer of what
that might be.
>> I'll request that and try to bring that
to the next.
>> Thank you.
>> And the next bullet is kind of in the
same I guess area the website assets
review from Commissioner Fletcher who's
not here. But do we know any I mean is
that how is that different from the park
features? I mean I guess what do you
know anything about that Graham or Mike?
Do you remember what that was? Because I
do.
>> I think that was about the river trail
having a map.
>> I was thinking
that was Fletcher asking for
at some point a presentation of the
website and what all is available there
because a lot of times when we're
talking about documents or where can I
find information, we're kind of told
it's at the website, but we're not. It
would be great to have the presentation
of how the you know what what all is at
the website all the work you've done.
>> Yes. Um
>> I think that's what I I don't want to
speak for Canon too much but I think
that's what he was asking.
>> Would you like to continue to keep that
on new business or wait until that would
come after we have an update on the
website as a whole because we would
hopefully present that after we've made
all the updates.
It's not my call, but you you can table
it till Canon's back in at the
commission.
>> Well, one comment would be is if if you
find that the website's not really going
to be updated until say spring of next
year or something like that, I think it
might be relevant, and I don't want to
speak for the the commissioners here,
but to have a um presentation on our
website as it currently stands so that
commissioners can understand. And
there's some feedback, some quick little
changes here and there that that we do
all the time, right? That might be
relevant. But I would only suggest that
if if you knew that the new update
wasn't going to be for say 6 months or
longer.
But if a commissioner want to Mike, if
you want to
>> I mean I I I believe that was Canon's
intent and so I would say yes, that
would be great.
>> Okay. I'll have an update next month.
>> Thanks, Graeme.
Uh, Commissioner Ellis last month
requested a Arkansas River Trail update.
Um, is there a park employee that can
provide that update?
Thanks everybody. Uh, yeah, that would
be neat if we could see any kind of
update on that. Um,
who who would handle that?
Is this the the map?
>> The Arkansas River Trail map. Yes,
>> that would be us, I believe.
>> Okay.
>> We just
um we would have to look into a third
party tool to utilize for it.
>> Okay.
>> Uh could you say what was the example
you gave again?
>> Oh, I need to send one to you. Um, since
the the map that Little Rock provides
hasn't been updated since 2017,
um, it's it's somewhat usable per se for
tourism and and locals, but for
instance, when we send bikes out, um,
we've made a digital map that shows
where you are in real time. It also has
all the different park names, restrooms,
points of interest, names of sculptures,
and um it just has the information for
people using the trail. Uh definitely
visiting the city to learn a lot about
Little Rock and uh make it interactive
and usable. Uh the one we had previously
was just a paper map with a couple of
lines drawn through the city which if
I'm wrong that's what a map is but uh
with technology I think we can make one
a little more user friendly a little
more interactive.
>> Yes I'll I'll get with our IT team and
see what
>> I'll send you the one we have too just
to give you an idea.
>> Yeah. Thank you.
>> Hey Samuel I have a question on that.
So, if you've have the technology and
you have the information and it's
already created, what are the chances
that the city the parks department in a
way or the city website is this can we
reuse this? Is there somebody that we
could purchase this information from? Is
this I mean what?
>> Yeah, I'll sell it to you.
>> Talk off.
>> I have a trade.
>> Trade many years ago, I made that map.
one of those maps that you said was just
a map with some lines on it or whatever
in a previous uh occupation here. And
so, um I know the challenge behind
finding all the assets and all the stuff
that you've done. So, I'm not I don't
want I'm not making light of what you've
done. I just think, man, if you've
already got it all laid out and it's
really
>> if the work's done with Yeah. And the
biggest change or the biggest help with
that too is that as things change all
the time, you know, if you're out there
and you're updating that information,
um, you know, to have our maps somehow,
you know, tied together in some way or
form or update or the revisions helpful,
too, because
>> yeah, there is one map that you can
create and then it can be shared and
when you make updates, it updates anyone
else that's using the map. So, for
instance, like uh on the website, you'd
have a digital interactive map. But
let's just say you're out walking um or
wanting to ride a bike and you are on
your phone, you could be able to scan a
QR code and it pull up on your phone.
So, a map with all the information. Uh
and then even a lot of bikes now have a
little phone holder. So when we send out
bikes to tourism, they actually have
their phone on their handlebars and are
following along uh the trail, which has
cut down a lot on uh people getting
lost, people ending up uh in the wrong
parts of downtown where they got off the
trail on accident. Um so it's it's been
helpful, but yeah, I can share that.
>> Okay. Thank you.
So now I'm the one that has to reply
with the update for my request. Fair
enough.
I fired.
Okay. Uh
the next two bullets it talks about
section 13 ordinance 2183.
Um Justin gave a presentation on it uh
about 10 minutes ago. Um, so and I know
Mike, we kind of said for Mike to to
kind of talk more about it uh in new
business. So I'm going to hand it over
to you Mike uh to get your uh continue
thoughts on it.
>> Okay. So I guess I would just ask does
do the commissioners have any questions?
But understanding that,
I'm going to propose that we set aside
15 minutes for next meeting for Justin
to come back with an enhanced version of
that presentation that covers all the
items within the ordinance. And then
coming out of that, if you don't have
any unanswered questions, then at next
meeting, we would propose
um having a public hearing on it. So,
uh, with that in mind, does anybody have
any general questions that we didn't
answer with Justin?
>> So, these public hearing dates that are
on the new business, those are those are
just for example, or do you know why
those are on there? It was the second to
last tab under new business.
>> Don't worry about those.
>> Okay, let's take that off then. And um,
but as Mike mentioned, if anyone has any
comments or questions on section 13,
>> I guess my comment is is anybody against
it?
Well,
>> and in all fairness, when Justin comes
back with a the complete staff report,
>> then we'll have the information for
people to decide whether they're against
it, I guess, would be
>> I guess based on what you've heard
today, is anybody feel compelled to like
a general aspect of like how
>> about where I think you're going? We
we're not at the right step of the
process to actually vote on it. we need
to have this next step to have the
complete staff report and then from
there we'll vote on whether we want to
move forward to the public hearing phase
and I I think uh if I can clarify what
what I would need before I come back
with the official report and the purpose
of today is if anybody has any questions
that they know needs to be included in
that report or or if you knew ahead of
time and could communicate that that way
it would save me doing the official
report and then something else that was
going to need additional research. So,
um, this is just a chance for y'all to
kind of communicate that through to make
sure it can get included in the report.
I
>> I guess my then my my thought is that on
the I'd like to have somebody look at
the right of first refusal. I guess
somebody from the city legal to see if
where if that's going to be an issue at
all um, regarding how much we can sell
it for.
>> So, um, that is one of the requirements
that will be met. There is a there will
be an official legal opinion on any
legal issues including the right of
first refusal if the commission would
like. I'm happy to just kind of like do
a bullet point summary of how 2183 works
so that you don't have to kind of read
through all of the parts. Just a here's
what we're doing here and what we're
looking for kind of thing if you'd like.
If not and you're completely wanting to,
I don't mind not doing it.
you know, extra work. But, um, it I
think it might be helpful as we go
through the process to be like, okay,
well, we checked off this step. Here we
are, and this is what we're looking for
and doing next.
>> But specific to session 13, I think I
guess there's questions about how much
it costs, how much we paid for it, and
the right of refusal. So, I mean, are
this are any city attorneys looking at
the actual purchase in 2001 and all the
documents right now, or could they
before next meeting? I'm not sure what
the process is, but
>> unfortunately I don't know the date that
it was assigned and I am not a real
estate attorney. I I do handle the
transactions in several of the
commissions. So I would not be able to
speak on I wouldn't feel that I would be
able to tell you exactly what it said
and give you that advice, but there is
there are people that should be working
on this. Um my understanding is that um
Director Couch has already submitted the
request to have legal look at it. So
there should be attorneys that working
on this.
>> Yeah, I'll comment or clarify that too.
So, as part of the uh policy, the asset
disposition policy for the parks
department, the first step, don't don't
quote me on this, but one of the first
steps is city manager approval. Um, and
so we've acquired that, the next one is
um and so let me say in that process of
me getting that approval, I asked for
the city attorney's office to review
this whole process. And as Simone has
indicated, part of the policy states
that there actually in our final
presentation, there will be a true legal
opinion that has to be a part of this
whole document. So before anybody has to
make any decisions here, all of these
things that you all are asking, which is
great. That's why we wanted to bring
this to attention now instead of having
these questions, you know, at the
presentation. So,
>> should we wait on that until we until
Justin has a presentation about what
this all means from a legal perspective?
>> I don't think we should because it
here's what I would like to do. So in
the um the ordinance 2183
section two discusses all the things
that should be considered and talked
about which we've talked about in the
master planning meeting but you know
also we'll we'll um you guys may have
some questions on but if you look at
section three it'll show uh show you all
the things Justin's going to cover in
the presentation for next meeting. And
so what I would like to do is propose
that we allocate 15 minutes in the next
meeting for that presentation. If for
some reason he doesn't get the legal
feedback that he needs to complete the
staff report, then we can table that
item at the next meeting. But I would
like us to go ahead and plan for Justin
to have his staff report complete for us
to listen to and then and then we can go
from there. I'll just say that if you
have any questions or comments for
Justin to do it, you know, email him
prior to because I I think to his point,
he doesn't want to go through it all
without you guys getting getting the
feedback from you from us before he he
he uh presents again. So,
>> just to sorry, are are you done
speaking? I don't want to interrupt. Um,
>> no, you're good. Yeah, you're good.
>> Thank you. I wanted to clarify that
please don't feel that this is your one
opportunity or that you have to come in
the next before the next meeting to tell
anyone about any questions you have
because we will have the report and then
there will be a public hearing like so
next time we can have the public hearing
so if you have additional questions we
can get those answered if someone comes
to you from the public and asks you
about them we can't answer them too so
don't feel that this is your one and
only opportunity to do that because we
will have additional time
>> yeah on that too just for me to note
um there is no like precise timeline or
a goal and timeline that staff and
myself are trying to meet. I mean, so if
we need to go farther and and delay it
even more in terms of what Mike has
helped us with and Simone and everybody,
we're happy to do that. We're not
there's not like we're trying to do this
so that we can do X project or
something. Um aren't we? So,
>> aren't we?
>> We're just kidding.
>> Yeah. Don't start that. I guess
I guess I recommend if we can just have
an open discussion
in new business next month talking that
maybe Justin can add more comments and
have Simone add a little more comments
on the ordinance that you mentioned some
bullet points just um just to get this
moving forward
with that word everybody.
>> May I make a suggestion
and feel free to tell me no.
>> No.
>> Um
>> go ahead.
>> Thank you. Um, so I think if we still
have the scheduled presentation report
study, then we still can check that off.
If we have additional questions, we can
still move to the public hearing. Um, if
it's not ready next month, then we can
table it. But I would hate to call it
something else and have people think
that it's not what it should be
>> and not have met a requirement.
>> Smart idea.
>> That's I'm good with that. That's fine.
>> That works.
>> Thank you.
>> Okay. So with that, I would like to
propose that we establish an agenda item
for next meeting for 15 minutes for
parks and wreck staff to provide a staff
report on the disposal
um proposition for section 13.
>> Second.
>> All in favor say I.
>> I.
>> All opposed.
Thanks, Mike. Um that last bullet item
is dates for parks commission golf
tournament. If just a background so two
years ago and years before that we did a
>> a golf tournament for
uh that benefited the parks conservancy
which benefited the uh playground summer
camp program I guess is what it's called
now. But we haven't done the past two
years and we were supposed to do in July
and just just fell through. But I guess
I'm just going to open up for discussion
if if we want to do do we want to
continue to do that. I think Mike would
do everything from a logistics as far as
I mean he's the the resin golf manager
so he could reserve the the 18 holes. He
could order the food. I think it's us to
help find sponsors and so um I would
like to avoid summer but I just any
feedback on if we want to do this again
and if so when would you would we like
to do it? I think it all depends on when
Resman Golf is open of course, but um
any any questions or comments about
this.
Okay. I might just uh maybe for next
minute I'll talk to Mike and maybe he
can throw out, you know, three to five
dates
uh maybe early spring and early summer.
Um, I don't know if we have time to do
it this calendar year, but I'll I have a
note to call Mike and
uh kind of go through that. So
>> just just to clarify um previously when
we were discussing the commissioner
Bernardo's um suggestion for the 15
minutes for Justin to present was that a
motion to have that on added to the
agenda or what exactly did or or the
proposal? What exactly did we do?
>> I think it was
>> the motion was to add it to the agenda
for next meeting.
>> Okay. So there was no Did you make the
agenda the motion yourself to add?
>> There's a second
>> and there motion second. Okay,
beautiful.
>> No worries.
Okay. Um, number nine's the agenda items
for next meeting. Um, I think we've
already got Mike's with that 15 minutes
and I know Graham's going to look at
some of that information that that Mike
requested about the um park features and
the website assets review and um I don't
anyone have anything else for net's
meeting?
>> And I'm just going to clarify just a
little bit more. Parks, let's make it
parks features directory. That way we
>> Simone's got me focused on terminology
today. So, it should be parks features
directory when you change the agenda
items.
>> That way, we won't lose track of what it
is.
>> Okay. I think Melan, you had something.
>> Yeah, I have something. Um, I know that
the commission here has always asked me
to um include you in in budget uh
discussions. Uh so, u I've been a little
bit distracted by this section 13
process, but um I am in the process of
working on our budget. I have been
requested to review um our budget in
regards to a uh 7% 7% reduction in our
budget. This is just to consider
options. Um there is nothing um that has
been finalized. Uh no uh concerns about
staff layoffs or anything like that.
This is just a study to see what would
be possible. So um I can uh I haven't
presented anything. I am presenting
soon. Um and and I really haven't wanted
to present anything because what it has
nothing has been I don't I don't know
exactly where it's going to end up. Um
you know because it's nothing has been
finalized. Um that being said, I think
it would be appropriate if I came and
presented something of our findings and
what the direction would be um in the
next month. Um it's a little bit I don't
know the exact process. I don't know if
any of the uh uh city board directors
would want to maybe comment on that. Um
but I just want to make sure I know last
year or previous years we always talked
about we we didn't have enough
discussion. So um any comments on that?
>> You want to do in September or like
October? You think?
>> So I would say it's sooner the better.
>> Okay. because we usually in August start
talking about budget and we're halfway
through August and we haven't. So,
>> okay, let's put something on September
for
Can I get a motion? I need to do that
for that. Okay, never mind.
>> Oh, yeah. I'll be right.
>> Well,
okay.
Um, that's it. We'll go to board
liaison. Um, Director Peek,
>> I've already talked about the events.
>> Director Lewis,
>> I don't have anything to add.
>> I do want to say again, the social media
team, y'all are on it. You post almost
every day. They're so well put together.
Kudos to to y'all. You're doing a great
job.
>> Thank you.
>> And thanks to Director Peek. She showed
me on Facebook. There's a hard post. So,
I was able to save it. You don't have
to. I was sharing it from Instagram, I
believe, yesterday or day before. So,
>> I schooled her. She knows her.
>> If you don't want to.
>> Yeah. Sign up and everything was out
there. So, thank you.
>> Okay. Uh with all that then uh next uh
meeting is uh same place um same time.
It's on September 10th. Appreciate
everyone's discussion and being here.
With that, that's adjourn.
>> Ben,
>> fire station.
>> I move that we adjourn the meeting at
12:57 p.m.
>> Oh. Uh, a second.
>> Simone looked at me.
>> I just meeting
>> have a second. And now we just need a
vote.
>> Oh.
>> All in favor of adjourning.
>> I
>> Nice to meet you, Chris. Welcome to the
