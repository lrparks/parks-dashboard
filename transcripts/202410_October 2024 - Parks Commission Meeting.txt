okay um the next item on the agenda
is the reports for director's reports
staff reports
events before hand it over to Leland are
there any questions on the staff
reports that were provided to you via
email prior to this commission
meeting Linda yes um I saw that the
grand opening of um
the sorry my my mind just went blank
under the correct name of it Jim Dy Jim
Daly fitness center and pool um what I
was wondering is has the attendance
picked up I know there were some
regularly committed swimmers are they
all returning uh is it fully utilized
right
now I'll be honest we don't have any
updated numbers to share I don't I can
ask staff to report back on that I do
know that when we shut down the pool
there was some requests for additional
pools to be used elsewhere and we paid
for um members to go to uler and so I
don't believe we lost um we didn't have
a big fallof in our membership
thankfully um so I don't think there's
going to be a big wave one way or the
other but um I will ask staff to give us
a report for next
month am I Leland concerning the safety
reporting is there any money in the
budget for AED out at Kanis next year uh
so there's always funds in terms of our
maintenance dollars um in terms of
safety items like that we don't have a
line item for safety as we've discussed
but um um we'll have Bond if we pass the
sales tax we'll definitely have the
funds to do it um so to answer your
question directly there's no funding for
you know just a line item for safety um
we already Perry how many 0d so we
roughly have in our
facilities what that so that's roughly
12 of them
so um that's where we stand today on
aeds hopefully we'll have some new
Revenue um I didn't ask for I only had
five options to ask for a new budget in
um for 2025 I just as a budget report as
a new budget request and those were for
um Golf and our senior programs facility
here because we need Staffing here um
those are our biggest items so
okay thank
you any other questions for the staff
britty how was the all the events that
happened in October so far pretty well
attended I
didn't sorry if I P on the spot
yes hello
everyone can you hear me yeah this on um
so I'm going to share some upcoming
events as well as um I wanted to
highlight a very special event that
happened at first T last weekend the par
three for
dipg um which was organized by um local
families um that have been afflicted by
that form of brain tumor um so what they
did is they had a um a family golf
tournament there and at nine of the
holes each of the holes they had a
special um activity at each hole so in
hole one they had a DJ dance party at
hole two they had um bits razor back um
where they painted bandanas um um they
had a food challenge at whole three a
dizzy cartoon hands where they move back
and forth on their golf carts with I
don't know it was just um a really great
event I encourage you to take a look uh
at the first te Facebook page where you
can see the event and then click onto
that organization they had like 75
pictures of these families and kids and
um it was really outstanding so that was
their first year I assume that they will
be doing it
again okay coming
up quite a few things October is that

Arkansas when the weather's beautiful so

Community Center on the

sustainability and everything that keep
Little Rock beautiful is doing and so

cleanup on October 26th it is from 9 to
1 it's a both a water and a land uh

beautiful and if you haven't been to
fush Creek and you want to you want to
really see what the litters like just go

promise you you seen it you know so
October 26 I hope a lot of a lot of

in that same vein um our volunteer
program coordinator worked with um many

great stuff going on let me know if you

questions thank you any other questions
for the staff before I turn over to to
Leland to talk about his uh board
director agenda items and to uh talk
about the new employees part
all right
will good afternoon um just wanted to
share briefly first I just got back from
Atlanta with um some of my upper staff
members we participated in a national
parks and recreation conference for a
week in Atlanta uh this is a yearly
conference that we attend as a a small
group of us go and we um go to education
classes and there's a major exhibit hall
and we find a lot of new uh programs a
lot of new um products and then we also
spent some time and we visited Atlanta
Parks um and went around so um we're
always challenging ourselves to continue
our education and wanted to share that
with you and we'll be headed out to
another one next year so um and we also
participated in the state conference
which was in Jonesboro very similar but
obviously um big difference between
State and National for us so
um so going on to the agenda items um
over the last month I was able to take
uh two things to the board for approval
one was the West Central uh Ballfield
complex which is a funded project
through arpa funds of a million dollar
it's a project to improve uh one uh
field at West Central Community Center
and um it was approve so I took it to
the board and then it was approved by
the board so that's uh one project and
the other one that was taken to the
board was the master plan for the I30
Crossing Park which is downtown which is
a new 15 acre Park which will is being
developed the green space is being
developed by the construction of the new
I30 Crossing through downtown Little
Rock and so we were successful in hiring
um we haven't finished the contract let
me say that but we did finish the
resolution approval bless you through
for uh Sasaki and Associates um saki
Associates did build out a team they're
a nation not Nationwide But Country
national uh company here and United
States but um they also partnered with
some local vendors uh EDG and um AMR and
a few others that uh are local here so
uh I can share more information on those
and then something that will be upcoming
that we plan to take to the board um the
next meeting is the Reser Reservoir Road
uh project so we've been slowly still
progressing at Reservoir Park and we
have a large it's about half a million
to
$600,000 uh project to repave and
rebuild all the road infrastructure and
reservoir park so that's our next big
phase at Reservoir Park and um those are
the big items that I have to share with
the the commission today and then um the
part new park employees these are all
new Park employees back here that have
already introduced themselves because
been asked sorry um but they some of
them have been here for a little bit
longer than others they're all involved
in some aspect of our Administration our
front desk and handling invoicing and um
all that good stuff so we couldn't do it
without them so appreciate you all being
here today and um if there's any
questions for them um we can go into
that process but that's all I have to
share today at the moment I
yes I have a question uh Leland that's
exciting about Reservoir Park uh at the
board meeting yesterday um Tad Bohanan
pulled me aside about a controlled burn
there yes so that that's that needs to
happen so I will speak briefly to the
control burn we um worked with CAW um
I'm blanking on the gentleman's name
right now that was a part of that but we
met with CAW several times when the
tornado first happened they brought to
our attention mentioned very quickly
that they wanted to try to do a control
burn there and we were um requesting
that they do a control burn across all
of the park too um if you've been
through Reservoir par there's a large uh
metal fence that's been reinstalled
there's that's a separation between
caw's area that they control and then
the Park area and so this um recent um
communication from them was that they
because of the fence they are not going
to burn or they are not going to offer
to burn any of the park is the control
burn and so it's only going to be on
caw's property and so I just said
something to the fact of you know we'll
we'll help in any way that we can but we
really don't want to be highly involved
in it because we're not involved in it
um and so um that's that's where it
stands um and but do we need a
controlled burn in other parts of the
park is that what you're saying uh We've
we've tried um to have control burns in
other areas of Park land across to 6,000
different Acres um I believe from a
sustainability standpoint that it would
be beneficial to have control burns the
challenge with control burns is that
most of all of our land is AB budding
some kind of urban fabric of the city
and whenever we start a fire just to
burn off debris tree vegetation debris
from a construction project or from a
storm project um we often get a lot of
calls from citizens complaining about
the smoke and the smell and all this
stuff uh obviously we can't control
where the smoke goes we you try to plan
that in a control burn the latest one
that I tried to have was at Western
Hills and I wanted to burn off a bunch
of the brush out on Western Hills from a
sustainability standpoint um and we just
never were able to get that to to work
um I think in some of our bigger areas
we could we've talked about even doing
fush you know you're talking about fush
today um but there's just a lot of
challenges and honestly I think most
people that I've talked to about control
burning are used to doing control burns
out in the middle of the National Force
and there's not a lot of you know assets
and housing and all that so I I I I get
that but I still think maybe there would
be a way to work with CAW just because
where they're going to be burning is you
know right on cantol near lewood near
Reservoir I mean if they're going to be
doing it and they need to do it anyway
you know he was cautioning me you're
going to probably get some oh yeah some
angry emails and calls from people but
if we're going to be there doing it
anyway that I would love for us to
coordinate a control burn if you think
that's the best solution and I've I've
been all through Reservoir I I I I know
it would be helpful right I would agree
with that um the concern of my
hesitation is that we are currently not
managing the control burn or have any
aspects of it so when we when you say we
are doing it it's not we we have no
involvement in but we could I asked I
asked the partner and they said right
now they uh did not want to do that
because of the fence because of the
fence and they didn't want to come into
the reservoir I can ask again I could
help you ask okay okay let's do that
okay thank
you put your
microphone can you put your down on the
repaving of the road Reservoir how much
of that is FEMA
reimbursed I don't I don't have the
exact numbers but it's all FEMA or
insurance right now um we're not using
any Capital dollars but we received
roughly $800,000 I believe in insurance
for that location and then we submitted
a um a proposal from a company um for I
think it was two or2 to3 million worth
of improvements through FEMA and so then
we're working out of that um and FEMA is
helping us on that aspect of it so uh
that's where we
are ask a followup on Reservoir
absolutely you were looking at possibly
redesigning are you putting the road
back in the exact same spot or is it
great great question um no we're not um
there's some changes um
so um I mean this could get into
detailed discussion and we could have a
map for it or whatnot but in general yes
um it's going back there is um a section
of road that was rediscovered or
reopened because it was closed that you
know and if you know it if you know the
area you know what I'm talking about we
do plan to um eliminate that completely
we're not going to have that cut through
anymore um the area where it turns into
one way we're we talked about changing
it to two-way through there um but that
gets into there's a fine line of when
you turn into developing and and need
Capital dollars and doing something new
so our fun funds that we have through
FEMA and insurance is really just to
repair replace what we have so the only
we're not doing the oneway change which
would would help with some challenges
there but that weird turn right there
after the oneway if you're going north
out of lewood yeah that hair pin right
where you have kind of a blinded turn we
did um we are shortcutting that and
we're going to blaze a new turn through
the woods right there so it's a it still
has a turn because we appreciate having
turns to slow traffic and not have a a
speed route through there but not to
have that weird um turn there and um I
think everything else is roughly staying
the same but we are repaving everything
there's a little additional parking lot
back there by the Pavilion that's extra
on CAW side by the fence that's an extra
30 or 40t deep um I think we planned on
cleaning that up and making that more of
an official parking lot stuff like that
but um
yeah cool I was just curious and then
the the 15 Acres that the sort of new
Green Space where the on and off ramps
used to be between correct it's um third
and whatever that is second second goes
through it and River Market and it's in
that whole area where um it's all if you
drive down there now it's all open Green
Space it's they're the r dos almost
finished so the contractor's almost
finished on our side okay
all right any other questions for
Leland thanks for the information on the
updates for the board director's meeting
um next item of the agenda is we we
talked about you know getting a a
presentation about the community center
projects you know we there've been a lot
of work
throughout uh multiple community centers
over the past couple years we wanted
Justin dorsu to speak about it he's he's
out today but I think Leland's going to
talk more about it he's got short
presentation to to talk about it and
then um kind of go from there looks like
there it
is okay so just because
of of timing Justin um was sick and so
we talked about not having this but we
know that there's probably going to be
another uh request for presentation next
month and so um I'm involved in these as
just as much as anybody and so U he he
prepared this presentation I tweaked it
um and mahogany has figured out a way to
do it through WebEx off of my laptop
through something over there so
hopefully this works and um we can go
through this so if you'll go to the next
slide so these These are arpa funds
these are funds that we received from
the board um I don't know exact to you
Year back in
2122 we received over $6 million that
was dedicated from the board um so that
$6 million breaks out to being $3
million for a senior facility a million
for West Central Ballfield complex which
I just spoke about about how we're
moving forward on that and 2 million in
general for community centers so we've
spoken before where we have five
community centers we picked four
community centers because West Central
was recently built in
201617 so we felt like 2 million uh
would go farther at four locations with
the concept of roughly breaking that
into
$500,000 increments across those
community centers but you'll see more as
as I go through the presentation next
slide these not to be confusing go back
one
please not to be confusing here this is
uh some additional AR projects funds
that I received so the city obviously
received a lot of different arpa funds 6
million was the original push to to
Parks this was some additional funds
that um were handled by City Board
directors and and you know that's how
they got the funds to us the $875,000
was dedicated to Junior deputy and uh
junior Deputy Ballfield complex is on
city property which we lease back to
Junior Deputy so we had 875,000
we had worked with a contract with musco
sports lighting and they installed um
all new lighting at the Ballfield
complex it was a detailed project in
terms of making sure we could bit all
the different ball field aspects there
for junior Deputy but it ended up being
a great project and the
$750,000 one there is the master plan
that I just mentioned um that I took to
the board last month so um those are all
Ora funds as to how those projects were
funded it's just another thing that
we've had to to manage and park so next
slide can you tell us what arpa is again
just so that American Rescue plan act so
there it's it's Federal covid relief
funds through the federal government so
they I think the city well I don't want
to say because I don't know exactly but
I think they received over you know $20
million roughly was I shouldn't even say
that I think it's more than that but
this is this is what I know from what I
was given from the board so so I briefly
mentioned 3 million for the senior
facility I just have some highlights
here in terms of each project um we
hired PK Stanley in half to do a design
and that facility senior facility will
be at this location I believe I've
discuss it a few different times here um
and so we can get into any detailed
discussions at the end of this and we
can come back I think the next slide is
just showing the um layout of that
facility next slide so this is a small
slide here just showing there's four
pickle ball courts planned for this
location um and then the the addition we
do have finalized construction plans for
this obviously I'm not going to be able
to go through all that today so I don't
have that here but we have interior
interior renderings of what this
facility look like will look like it has
a new therapeutic pool that will be
added between here and the parking lot
um in that addition and so we can go
through some details on that the next
one is West Central Ballfield complex um
this project so I said we had a million
I added a little bit of money to that
because the bid came in um just a little
bit so that
one 1.04 go back to the right here um
that's the uh with contingency for
Bradford um just if you could stay right
here that'd be great um so craft and
toll was the design company uh we'll be
building a brand new 250 ft uh ball
field there and Bradford
is the the bid the successful bid and
musco lights are there as well so it's
it's going to end up being a little
almost a 1.3 million project when it's
all said and done that gives you an idea
what facilities for um Ballfield
complexes cost for us today next
slide dragging okay sorry that's part of
doing what we're doing uh this is just a
quick rendering showings the
improvements there uh the backdrop is is
going to be something new and neat for
us which will be uh netting instead of
fencing uh allows for great views and
access to the ball field uh this will
not be artificial turf it'll be all
natural um they're infield obviously but
um everything will be brand new this
will be setting the standard for our
West Central Ballfield
complex and with the hope that with the
sales tax passing uh we'll have the
funds in that sales tax to renovate all
the ball fields so we'll have it
existing I mean a whole brand new
complex there at West Central next
slide um this is just the list of the
four community centers next
slide at Stevens Community Center we
originally so what we did was we hired a
a consultant to go and look at every
Community Center all four of them early
on we did a whole design process and
some of them came up with like East L
Rock came up with over $6 Million worth
of improvements because we looked at the
outside and we ma did a master plan it
really depended on um the assets that
the each Community Center has so if you
know Stevens Stevens is is a uh attached
to a local school there and because of
that we really have a small you know
complex here so what we did at Stevens
was we said go in there and we need to
um the biggest thing you can see the
list of items there is what we're doing
but the biggest thing was let's
resurface the um the gym floor paint
things fix the roof um new HVAC items
like that those are the big items here
at Stevens so it's more of a just a um
an upgrade to the existing facility
there next
slide so East Little Rock we hired EDG
and they hired these other Consultants
along with them and we went really went
through a process of a complete master
plan you can see the cost estimate at
$5.1 million so we have a really cool
design for this whole facility here uh
this is a community center that was
built and really active in the
1970s um and is not active now it was
shut down from the city the board shut
it down in 2006 roughly and it's just
been kind of used for uh odd and ends
over the many many years um we have or I
have a vision to utilize this for
special events to help offset the new
senior facility that will be planned I
mean that is will be located here and so
we started with this whole design we
ended up picking out a few items um
which is in that description there which
is gym floor painting lights um a lot of
demolition of a lot of old outstanding
buildings and an old swimming pool and
so the bid came in at uh just over half
a million dollars and so that that's the
plan for East L Rock next
SL and by the way Stevens and East L
Rock are both under construction as
we're speaking uh Southwest uh same kind
of concept but we hire Cromwell to do
this design so we look through the whole
facility uh Southwest has our uh one and
only outdoor pool for community centers
and so this has a lot to do with the
pool is in that 1.5 we were able to pull
out another these items which is really
heavily focused on gem floor lights air
conditioning
all just the kind of the the meat and
butter bread and butter the potatoes
whatever you want to say of the of the
facility sorry um so the bid was
$647,000 um and we are finalizing
contract or actually we have a
pre-construction meeting out there next
week next
slide and our last one here is dumbar
and you can see the cost estimate was
2.8 million this facility um is one of
our oldest ones as well and it needs a
lot of help um the biggest issues that
we had there were roof so we really
focus heavily on the roof we've already
completed a phase one uh roof uh
renovation because it was really leaking
into the facility and that was
$134,000 what we'll do is as some of the
contingencies um are lower or higher in
the other facilities we'll be able to
accomplish more at dumbar uh some of the
other ones just came online faster and
so we still plan on spending roughly
$500,000 at dumb bar um but as you can
see here most of that's going to be in
the roof um I hate to say that because
nobody's going to see the roof but it's
just not um the right thing to do is to
to do improvements downstairs when we
have a roof that is leaking that bad um
so again these are just little stabs at
at uh bigger problems that we have next
slide oh this is just a quick slide
showing that out of $2 million that we
were funded out of arpa funds we added
up all the needs that were from all the
engineers and everybody we have roughly
$10 million so we need to come up with
another $8 million just to get to our
head above water at these community
centers this is not adding anything
really that new in any of them other
than East L Rock just because it's it's
so far behind um and hopefully that will
be accomplished in our sales tax I do
have uh $8 million in the sales tax for
community centers so um that ends my
slideshow presentation if anybody has
any questions i' be happy to
answer that was fantastic thank you for
that uh overview Mike um as usual I have
the pickle ball question so as they're
doing all these multiport floors they I
hope they are including pickle ball
lines right uh great question Mike so
yes at when they're resurfacing the
courts at the different community
centers yes there's um new lines for uh
pickle ball in fact we were at
Southwest reviewing it just recently and
we were uh discussing that but um we do
need to I'll make sure that we have that
noted again just so it doesn't get
dropped off thank you you it's Mike
Quinton um what's the most popular
Community Center and and do you know
like kind of average attendance or
obviously it's not East Little Rock
right but oh so East Little Rock not is
not but so that's a great question um
when I first became director um
obviously I've been here for a long time
in terms of um Parks but I was never
that heavily involved in community
centers s Sue who's been here for over
50 years that's a joke 40 something
years but uh probably could answer that
question better but um what's
interesting about our community centers
are that I originally wanted to um not
have them so siloed and have them more
like okay well if we're going to have
this program there we're going to have
it at the other on I quickly figured out
that um that was not a good idea to try
to do that and that all of these are
very siloed because of the neighborhoods
that they're actually in and and the
people that the user groups of these
facilities so Southwest has a certain
User Group whereas West Central is
something else um all of our programs um
vary a little
bit so we Britney is um filling in for
our data coordinator because our data
coordinator position is empty um
comes in 35,000 Ann
attendance then STS so in order um
Southwest roughly 35,000 a year last
year then Stevens at
30,000 Dunbar at
25,000 um then the senior programs at
East Little Rock had 20,000 the center
here had 20,000 and West Central had
20,000 what does that number repres
that Jim Daly on there she didn't
mention it was over
100,000 um just a followup to that um
when you were talking about the junior
uh Deputy ball fields and the lights I
saw that is Episcopal having there are
they renting some of that space out from
the city or how is that how's that yeah
right so um good question um so we had
lease through with Junior Deputy um they
did come to us and they said we're
trying to raise funds for improvements
at our facility um that's how I'm
assuming the conversation got started
about the arpa funds uh you'd have to
ask uh director Webb that question or
maybe director uh gappy has has some
more information on that of how that got
funded but I know that they were also at
the time talking to Episcopal about hey
um they get some funds from Episcopal I
don't know that exact Arrangement
because that's through them um but so
the that Episcopal Arrangement was not
through the city we we just managed the
lease through all all of the ground all
the um amenities on the ground are all
managed by Junior Deputy they're not our
our um actual assets are they allowed to
suas it if they are Su leasing it well
that's at that point we need to okay we
need to review the contract
yeah I'm not asking for you to do that I
was just wondering yeah yeah no I mean I
I just don't want to speak to it because
um I mean we have a major lease in
contract and I don't I Beth could
probably say there's without having the
contract in front of me it's not
appropriate probably to say what's one
way or the other but we could definitely
look into that you could look into it
though
yeah thank you Linda
so Brittney were those 2023 numbers okay
so that's last year and you had 20,000
here well the Well it's eventually gets
closed I think that was was that for the
senior I believe she said senior
programs is really only meetings have
been going on here that's right no
program rney Britney can you go to the
podium can't hear you she she was just
saying the majority of that was in the a
third quarter second quarter of
2023 um but you're right um this
facility has been closed for a couple
years for the board meetings and because
of covid and all kinds of things and um
it the board meeting now just if the
Public's listening has moved back to
City Hall same with the Planning
Commission meeting we're still having
our meetings here we're bidding the
construction phase of this year um in
the next couple weeks hopefully and then
based on that we hope to start
construction here uh first of next year
so we might have to find another
location for ourselves and then once
that construction's finished this will
be back open just to give it a little
bit more information on this
facility just for the sake of time I'm
going to I'm going to probably end this
presentation now and move on to uh
unfinished business thanks Leland for
okay thank you all very much that was
really good thank you um does anyone
have questions on unfinished business uh
I was just going to lay it out there if
you don't I'm G move on to new business
because we have a lot to talk about in
new business um but if anyone wants to
bring up any questions or comments from
from unfinished business please please
do that now if not we'll move on to new
business okay let's move on to to new
business um we've got six items here and
I think the Bulet we be talking about
the sales taes because we're less than a
month out from the election um but first
I want to talk about is anyone any of
the subcommittees have reports it's okay
if you don't I think yeah so uh for a
master plan um what I'm wanting to do
and just for those of you that are on
that committee you
feel free to speak up but I'm hoping I'm
wanting to have that either before or
after our next Parks Commission meeting
in November which will be after election
day
so I think it's better to wait until
after election day because the
conversation could obviously go two
completely different directions um what
I'm envisioning is not really to get a
make Leland get a presentation together
in such a short period of time but
really more just to have a general
discussion and outline what we want that
committee to look like uh moving forward
and um and and get started on more
frequent uh meetings so that being said
for those of y'all on that committee do
you prefer before after it's irrelevant
to
me okay well we'll just say after um and
then we'll get whatever notices we need
to get
done should be plenty of time to get
that done yes you can U work with the
parks department they will get the
required notice
out any other subcommittee
reports okay I the new commission ideas
for 2025 I I this has been on our new
business for the past two times I kind
of want to table it until after the
election I think that could change based
on the election results and I kind of
want to just focus on the election
um because that's kind of what the main
the main uh main current event going on
in part so um with that uh MOG if you
can just table that to next that's month
that that's okay um the sales tax
initiative uh I just kind of wanted to
open it up just
to a dialogue um what are you guys
hearing I mean I'm not seeing a lot on
any forms of social media or Media or
signs or Billboards I'm just curious
what everyone's seeing about Sal set I I
think this is Ben France talking not the
chair of sales I think it's a coin flip
to me it's going to pass I don't know
what what you're hearing director PEC
but would love just to have a dialogue
before we get into into action items for
the
parts I I can give you an update on the
campaign uh considerable amount of money
has been raised privately to push this
and I like a lot of my colleagues on the
board have been wondering when is it
going to start because the election is
in what 20 days is that right next week
for early voting right yeah so um
because of the holiday I think it
supposed to drop Saturday Monday the
holiday I think the big massive mailers
and television uh advertising will start
I mean we ought we all ought to have a
mailer at home today uh so so there is a
big uh concentrated effort a lot of this
is thanks to the Chamber of Commerce 50
for the future and other uh individuals
and businesses who uh feel very strongly
about this uh the buzz on the street I'm
hearing I mean either people absolutely
want it or absolutely don't want it yeah
my fear is that it's such a already
contentious divisive election and my
fear is people will just go in and vote
for their presidential choice and then
walk out uh it's a little bit confusing
because there are actually two votes the
38 and the 58 so that's just a big
education piece but the people running
that Campa campaign are very smart and
Savvy there will be a lot of social
media and I I I honestly think in the
next 24 to 48 hours we're going to see
it and then we're going to be bombarded
with he running it the campaign uh I
don't know if I'm supposed to say okay
don't worry about it that's fine
okay am I um so I'll just note the
ballot itself doesn't provide any detail
at all so it just says 3 a for
operations 5 a for for Capital the
people that I've been talking to they
don't know what it is and by default
it's no new tax you know so once you
explain what it is and of course we have
all kinds of educational materials but a
lot of people don't want to go look for
that so if they don't intuitively hear
it from
somewhere then I'm afraid they're going
to get to the ballot and say what's this
tax
and I think their defaults going to go
against us but just my thoughts I'd like
to ask Cappy if you know that there's
two lines is my understanding there's
going to be one for a vote for 38 and
one for 58 is that correct correct my
understanding is if one doesn't pass
then the whole thing doesn't pass is
that correct do you know I don't know
the
answer this is the first I heard that
it's actually two different items just
it it's it's it's really confusing um I
mean to be totally honest you know I I
wanted to wait until May just because of
the election and it is complicated and
it's always easy to get things passed in
a special election you know a one item
thing but you know I mean I kind of tend
to uh be the eternal optimist and um you
know my thought is even if it if it
doesn't pass there's no nothing that
says we can't go for a May election with
a a single issue yeah I mean that's the
way we passed the restore Robinson
campaign and I mean so many so many
others you know that's something that
you know Bobby Roberts when he was at
Cals he always always went for the
special election so I don't know it just
looks it's going to be a long ballot and
I I'm just I don't know again I'm the
paternal Optimist and I hope that the
campaign helps people who are either on
the fence or do not understand the
impact that this could make in the city
I just hope that it's effective and and
it was deliberate to to wait this long
to do it you're saying on the sample
ballot that's online you've seen it and
it it's nothing no explanation no it's
it's very I mean I have that I have it
if anybody wants to see it but it it one
through the 38 for operations within
Little Rock I don't know how how did
that slip by on I mean that just seems
crazy to me because yeah you're you're
absolutely right if if they don't know
what that's for it's a no right if it
would have at least had like the the
four Ps or something I think it would
have been is that where's that on is
that in the city of lck or is it did you
just Google it Count's website oh the
plasy county yeah I haven't I haven't
seen the ballot I know you can go to
vote plasy I I just heard I just text
KRA that question and she said one could
technically pass and the other could
fail
okay yeah there was an article today in
the paper there's a I don't know if
you've seen it yet but is there
organization that's against the sales
taxs um that Arkansas Community
organizations has come out against the
sales tats so I mean there there's going
to be a group that's opposed it which is
fine but
um any other dialogue or anything before
we get into the kind of letters are
support
um yeah um I got this little pin here at
harvestfest and it's a good thing to to
wear because people will ask you about
it and that gives me a chance to talk to
people about the cell stack what's it
say I'm just having it says um invest a
penny for the results for the rock was
there like a tin at horsefest that yes
specific for Sal stats yes okay cool you
have any more B pens this is the only
one I have April Jackson gave it to me
okay um going to letters of support I
I've I've written two letters one that
would be this would be letters uh to the
Democrat Gazette in an email I sent to
you guys there was I put in a link that
you can send a personal editorial letter
to to the as a member of the parts
recognation letter to the org Democrat
cazette I hope you guys will write a
letter um supporting the sales tats and
why it's good for the city I've written
a personal letter that I'm going to
submit I've also written a letter that's
on behalf of the commission itself and
I've got it here
Beth sorry yes yes I've got a letter
that I was going
to present here if there needs to be a
change if someone doesn't agree with it
or the grammar
like what it can it can it later be
approved do you have a copy of the
letter was it handed out to all of the
Commissioners
yeah I would suggest that all of the
Commissioners at the meeting today
receive a copy of the letter and have a
quick chance to review it and then um
You can call for motions to approve but
what if what if they're like uh line
eight is not very good or like what do
we have to some of it there could be a
suggestion or a motion to change it has
to be done here yes okay so they we
can't do
it they read it tonight and they say he
Ben this would have to be done in a in a
regular business meeting or specially
called meeting for this purpose I can't
email it out and they no
okay well just if you can kindly read it
um I've caught some grammar errors
already so um I did it last
night
but
um I move that the commission approved
this letter with minor grammatical
changes and submit it uh with all of our
signatures
attached what are the changes um second
paragraph second sentence and his
there's an extra
t i don't let me go back if you guys
think of personal letter is more
effective we don't have to have this
letter from the board it's it's up to us
uh I just wanted
I think the more the the more the
marrier I mean if it's if it's personal
from Linda and personal from me or
personal from Mike and then we do it as
a group um I'm not a PR expert so I
just um
yeah is that all of the the changes that
you have commissioner Smith that's all
I've seen I'm if anyone else has CAU
anything
else when you say a signature do we have
to sign it today or does it well the
letter would need to be corrected with
whatever amendments ORS would need to be
made and and
then I would like someone
from I try to make sure not only grammar
but but this is accurate as far as
everything I talk about so
so and if it's too late we can just do
personal I know I SP this I don't mind I
don't mind doing this and be fine with
me and I'm happy to sign it
but to me individual letters are more
impactful because when people see
blanket from the this group with all
these
signatures you never really know who
wrote it or if they just rber stamped it
or what if everybody really believes
that following Robert's Rules of Order
there is a motion on the
floor I
mean I know there's a motion but can I
have to can we talk about this
first well there's a motion and you
would need to have a second to the
motion and then discussion if if you're
strictly following Robert sches okay if
there's no second then it goes away if
there's no second the motion
fails is there a second
yeah second
it
okay now you can talk okay I talked to a
PR expert that not to be named I'm not
going to name him but he said to JT's
Point like a
personal letters more effective um I
wanted to go ahead and write this that
this is something that we wanted to do I
don't want to
just spring it on you guys without you
know five minutes of looking over it so
um I'm up I'm open to whatever you guys
think I'm more inclined favoring with
with JT and I just want I want hopefully
all of us to hopefully write a letter
and submit
it um well I agree with JT's point and
your point as well I think we have a
better chance of getting published in
the paper if it's from a group um I mean
the Arkansas Democrat Gazette the way I
understand I've never worked there but
they get a ton of letters all the time I
mean some people I'll come up to some
people and say hey I saw your letter to
the editor and they're like I wrote that
five months ago really and so um you
know they don't even know we got
published because it was on random
Tuesday so I think you know this letter
at this length um is good that to be
from the whole commission just to show
that you know the the commission of the
parks and rec support support what the
you know the mayor has put forward and
the City Board has put
forward hey Mike um so my opinion is I
kind of align to JT as well but if we
were to send this letter I would
probably move to strike paragraph five
because it's got a very personal tone to
it and doesn't kind of sound right with
multiple
signatures and um and it kind of aligns
the parks to focuses on kids but I think
there's a whole lot of adult usage of
our park so I think that's yeah I guess
I was just trying be a little more
specific in what the part program does
um but I'm I'm you guys think it's more
personal I'm fine with striking
it commissioner Smith do you want to
amend your motion to strike paragraph
five as as well as correcting
grammatical errors
you can't have an i paragraph if it's a
we I agree yeah that was yes I am uh
agreeable to strike paragraph
five there a
second
second paragraph five is a vote on
it or can we just is it
strike if discussion is if you're
finished with your discussion you can
you can call for all those in favor with
the the motion the amended motion okay
all those in favor of approving this
commission letter say
I
I I'll
opposed okay and that that would be with
the correcting any grammar errors errors
as well as striking paragraph 5 tell me
about do we have to have signatures I'm
just from a logistic standpoint and
usually the chair of the Commission in
the past is the letter letters that go
out on behalf of the
commission
and okay I will strike paragraph five
and then change that gramat grammatical
error and then I'll sign it on behalf of
the
commission any other questions sales
tats related letters
related I just have a comment it is so
helpful to have the presentation we had
today with the arpa funds for me to
understand where differents of money are
coming from and the improvements that we
can make and the tremendous need uh to
see 10 Mill almost $10 million
identified uh for the community centers
and we have two million those are the
kinds of important facts that I think we
can talk about now because uh I can go
out and really say you know we could do
the roof but we couldn't do more uh and
that's what the sales tax will help us
with and I think those kind of specific
items really show the community that we
make good use of the funds that we
receive in parks and Leland and his
staff are doing a great job but the
maintenance just continues to pile up
and so I think uh Leland it's been so
helpful this year to me to see the the
the type of reports we're getting the
more in-depth the reports to really show
us different centers um and different
programs that we have and the needs that
are there um and that's what to me parks
and the community support is all about
so thank you let's move on okay let's
move on to the nuts agenda item the
dashboard Mike is there something you
wanted to bring up um and because of
time I would you want do defer to next
month that to next month okay all right
and then the next agenda item is social
media subcommittee name change um Mr
chair you have in your packet
um a proposed amendment to The Parks
Commission
bylaws in article 7 appointment of
committees changing the name uh from
Outreach social media to
marketing and according to the bylaws to
amend the bylaws the proposed change to
the bylaws needs to be submitted at a
regular business meeting which would be
this one and voted on at the next
regular business meeting that would be
November
okay sub today we vote yeah right
submitted today voted to be voted on in
the next meeting in
November having this in new business is
that submitting
it pardon me say that again having this
a new business is that submitting
it yes yes that is submitting it okay
okay so
okay thank you
um any under I guess next item is agenda
items to next meeting I think we're
going to talk
about 2025 commission ideas and then M's
going to talk about the
dashboard um any other any other thing
that we want to see next month whether
it's presentations or new
business we were talking about spending
some money yeah
for sure well we won't get it all at
once just you know a few
passes we'll either be having a party or
reorganizing fact I have a couple items
to share yeah so going along with what
Linda said um just I'll leave this up to
you all to decide but there's also
another big group of funds that we're
using or utilizing right now which are
bond funds and so um if you ever wanted
staff to report out on what we're
utilizing the bond funds for um that was
a Citywide vote where we uh received a
lot of funds and we've already spent um
$6 million of it so allocating for next
year um and then the one other thing
that I wanted to ask uh the commission
is um Brittney here is starting um we've
been wanting to get this started for a
while and we just had a lot of other
things to to get caught up on in terms
of marketing and social media without do
it for 6 years but we're at the point
where we were ready to start our
newsletter we have an idea that we like
for y''s input um into that and so our
thought process is at the end of each
meeting we could just quickly say what
are the top three things that we
gathered from this meeting that we think
are um relevant for the citizens or
residents to hear and so if y'all would
be willing to do that just to say you
know well we thought it was this this
and this and Brittney would take that
and run with it and add the to our
newsletter with maybe some other stuff
that we wanted to add in there so that's
all I have yeah I'd like to Echo what
Linda said earlier um you guys are doing
a great job with the funds and it the
presentations we
get um they sort of get siloed away in
the website sort of buried down and I'd
almost say those
presentations if you're doing a
newsletter those should go out with it
so that people can actually
see the 10 million of you know needs and
two million of spending and you know
sort of I think it would be impactful
because I think that those presentations
you guys have done this year uh
everybody um it they've really
been the best part of the meetings to me
I mean it we're we're learning a lot and
able to hopefully uh help you all going
forward so so do we want to discuss the
the top three items for Britney
let's just do the the presentation I
think about the arper funds number one
your main focus should be sales tax
true that'd be great
yeah you might highlight
the it up what when are you sorry if I
missed this but when are you planning on
sending this out after each commission
meeting is it
monthly
okay where you going to be using like
emails from the marathon and
other emails have been signed up Britney
can you to the
mic
okay Britney can you go to the mic to
answer his
questions thank you yes so um the
question was what database would be
using to send out the newsletter um I
have
about 40 pages of handwritten names and
emails from signin sheets and tabling
and the eclipse that need to be um data
entry logged and um the team at the
marathon division once they get done
with creep and crawl which is this
Saturday by the way I forgot to say
creep and crawl this Saturday at Two
Rivers um they're going to help me with
that data entry so we have a small list
of already opted in people that have um
shared interest over time and then we'll
probably a larger opt-in campaign with
some of our other customer
databases great thank you Britney you
might also consider anyone who has ever
signed up to be a volunteer I know you
have a pretty big volunteer database
that's a big list so yeah well they'll
be included in the opt-in campaign
essentially send it out once and like
give them the opportunity to
unsubscribe Bry I have you up there um I
know you and I talked about it after the
last meeting but I just wanted to to get
it out here on the commission notes I
guess um that I made a suggestion to
Britney that we create a Parks
directory whereas today we seem to have
a lot of lists of parks and what's at
each Park but I think it would be great
for us to have a list of features and
then where all those features are at so
I'm threw that out there for her
consideration I just wanted to let the
commission know
that I'll add to that I know where're
running over time but we've we've
already been working not exactly on that
but as everybody runs around and says uh
we have 63 Parks right what are the what
are those what are those 63 parks and we
always have this long list of locations
um Perry has been helping me and other
staff and we're actually um categorizing
those Parks into large Regional Parks
neighborhood parks um natural areas and
we're we're really identifying what are
our actual real Parks um and I know it
sounds crazy like Hey we're talking
about this in 2024 we've been Associated
for so many years but when you look at
say something like resmond Park Road and
you have resond golf course and you have
Murray and you have the big damn bridge
and all that is that three parts or is
that one part and so that's what we're
really trying to Define um even down
like this facility here at University
Park you have the center maybe some of
you didn't even know is called
University Park but this University Park
has the center and resiment Tennis
Center so is that two or three or one
location anyway we're working on
defining that and we'll present that to
youall when we have that finalized so
you're saying we might have 83
Parks actually it looks like we might
have a few more but a lot of them are
natural areas um there's about 11 or 13
that are actually truly natural areas so
a natural area is any piece of property
that is is considered a Park area but
has no amenities in it and so we're
gonna Define those as natural areas so
like Taylor Loop Park is not going to be
called Taylor Loop Park it's just a
natural area under Parks and Recreation
because there is physically nothing
there from a standpoint of a
park but that's that's to be defined and
ongoing probably something we'll come
out with next year so to to Mike's Point
um City of Tulsa was dealing with we did
a lot of work for them this last summer
and they were dealing with that on uh
expanded from like six pickle ball
courts to I think 38 or 40 now that we
did and uh people didn't know you know
and so they were doing the same thing
scrambling okay where can we tell people
whether there's basketball courts or
ball or playgrounds or you know same
thing I mean
it's historically you always just had
the list of names and not the features
and sort of you know making it go DC for
people we have worked on an asset list U
we need to continue to work it's very
good the one that I saw but and then
Britney's been working on our website
and under our list of and that's that's
kind of where we started with this
naming thing as well is wow there's this
long list of parks on our website and a
lot of them aren't defined what are
those things so now we'll be able
actually categorize on the website these
are neighborhood I'm coming to town or I
live in town I want to to neighborhood
park you click on neighborhood parks
whereas right now it's just 60 names and
you just pick what you want so and then
in within that we're defining the assets
So eventually Kana spark would list
here's all the things some of them
already have start we' started on those
the ones that get more requests anyway I
know again we're over time so that's
another discussion but and that's the
last thing I'd bring up I think the
meetings are too short we're always
rushed at the end so we say that again
I'm sorry we're always rushed at the end
I think the meeting's either too short
or we have to chop something else which
we've already compressed the staff
reports into a
quick it just feels like there's not
enough time so so in your subit and
ending 15 later subcommittee sorry if I
cut you off but in the master plan
meeting that's that's could to be where
we discuss more about the naming of
parks and the assets and the list and
stuff like that you know and the
newsletter would be more defined in like
social media media and marketing and
stuff like that just saying there are
some other options
there at a it's all year I've already
done my are you sure well I could go on
but it's you know 110 all right well
thank you everyone and next couple weeks
please be focused on promoting the sales
tats and um I plan to send a recap email
hopefully this week and just summarizing
what we talked about I think it's just
good for us to keep in mind
because I sometimes forget you know that
we should be doing more than just
meeting once a month and we should be go
out there and touting our parts
especially the sales T so um just
remember to you know to publicize your
support for the sales tats um and
hopefully we'll have some good news in a
couple weeks and we can
