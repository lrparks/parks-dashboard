            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none space-y-6 text-gray-700">
                <p>This dashboard is an independent analytical tool developed to support the Little Rock Parks and Recreation Commission in fulfilling its statutory oversight and advisory responsibilities under Little Rock Code Section 2-330. The commission is charged with consulting and advising on policies, operations, maintenance, and expansion of the park system, as well as recommending budget priorities to the city manager and Board of Directors.</p>

                <p>Effective oversight requires systematic access to performance data, trend analysis, and the ability to identify where advocacy and policy recommendations can best serve the public interest. This dashboard consolidates monthly division reports, financial data, and operational metrics into an accessible format that helps commissioners understand departmental performance, spot emerging issues, and make evidence-based recommendations for resource allocation and policy improvements.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Data Sources and Methodology</h3>

                <p>All data presented in this dashboard is derived from official monthly division reports submitted by Little Rock Parks and Recreation staff, supplemented by publicly available budget documents and meeting minutes. Where data points are not yet available, they are marked as placeholders (typically shown as "---"). This is a working document that will be updated as historical data is compiled and verified.</p>

                <p>The dashboard uses a metric identification system that corresponds to standardized reporting categories across five divisions: Administrative Resources, Operations, Recreation, Volunteer, and Organizational Safety. Benchmark comparisons draw from the National Recreation and Park Association's annual performance reviews for agencies serving populations of 100,000 to 250,000 residents.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Current Status and Limitations</h3>

                <p>This dashboard is currently under development. Not all historical data has been compiled, and some reporting categories are still being standardized with department staff. The information presented here represents the best available data at the time of publication but should not be considered comprehensive or final. Users should verify critical information through official city sources before making decisions based solely on dashboard data.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Independent Community Resource</h3>

                <p>This dashboard is independently maintained as a public resource and is not an official publication of the City of Little Rock or the Parks and Recreation Department. It represents one commissioner's effort to make oversight data more accessible to fellow commissioners and the public. The views, analysis, and presentation choices reflect the work of community volunteers and do not represent official city policy or departmental positions.</p>

                <p>For official information about Little Rock Parks and Recreation, please visit the city's website or contact the department directly. For questions about this dashboard or to report data discrepancies, please use the feedback mechanisms provided through the project repository.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Purpose and Public Benefit</h3>

                <p>The Parks and Recreation Commission bylaws require submission of an annual report to the Board of Directors addressing "the state of operations, facilities and programs." This dashboard supports that mandate by providing commissioners with ongoing access to performance data rather than requiring year-end compilation alone. By making this tool publicly accessible, we hope to foster greater transparency, enable informed public participation in commission meetings, and demonstrate how data-driven oversight can strengthen municipal services.</p>

                <p>Transparency in government operations serves the public interest. Residents deserve to understand how their parks system is performing, where resources are allocated, and what challenges the department faces. This dashboard is offered in that spirit of open governance.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Acknowledgments</h3>

                <p>This project builds on the foundational work of the 2001 Little Rock Parks and Recreation Master Plan and ongoing efforts by department staff to improve reporting and accountability. We are grateful to division directors who prepare monthly reports that make this analysis possible, and to the commissioners who continue working to ensure Little Rock's parks serve all residents effectively.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Legal Basis for Commission Oversight</h3>

                <p>The Little Rock Parks and Recreation Commission operates under authority granted by the Little Rock Board of Directors. Among the commission's enumerated responsibilities are consulting with the Parks Director on budget needs, recommending capital funding allocations, advising on master plan implementation, and reporting annually to the Board of Directors. This dashboard serves as a tool to fulfill those duties more effectively.</p>
