            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none space-y-6 text-gray-700">
                <p>This dashboard is an independent analytical tool developed to support the Little Rock Parks and Recreation Commission in fulfilling its oversight and advisory responsibilities under Little Rock Code Section 2-330. The commission advises on policies, operations, maintenance, and expansion of the park system and recommends budget priorities to the city manager and Board of Directors.</p>

                <p>Effective oversight requires access to performance data, trend analysis, and the ability to identify where advocacy and policy recommendations can best serve the public interest. This dashboard consolidates monthly division reports, financial data, and operational metrics into an accessible format that helps commissioners understand departmental performance, identify emerging issues, and make evidence-based recommendations for resource allocation and policy improvements.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Data Sources and Methodology</h3>

                <p>All data in this dashboard comes from official monthly reports submitted by Little Rock Parks and Recreation staff, supplemented by publicly available budget documents and meeting minutes. Where data points are unavailable, they are marked as placeholders (typically shown as "---"). This is a working document that will be updated as historical data is compiled and verified.</p>

                <p>The dashboard uses a metric identification system that corresponds to standardized reporting categories across five divisions: Administrative Resources, Operations, Recreation, Volunteer, and Organizational Safety. Benchmark comparisons draw from the National Recreation and Park Association's annual performance reviews for agencies serving populations of 100,000 to 250,000 residents.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Current Status and Limitations</h3>

                <p>This dashboard is under development. Not all historical data is compiled, and some reporting categories are being standardized with department staff. The information represents the best available data at publication but should not be considered comprehensive or final. Users should verify critical information through official city sources before making decisions based solely on dashboard data.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Independent Community Resource</h3>

                <p>This dashboard is independently maintained as a public resource and is not an official publication of the City of Little Rock or the Parks and Recreation Department. It represents one commissioner's effort to make oversight data more accessible to fellow commissioners and the public. The views, analysis, and presentation choices reflect community volunteers' work and do not represent official city policy or departmental positions.</p>

                <p>Visit the city's website or contact the department for official information about Little Rock Parks and Recreation. Use the feedback mechanisms in the project repository for questions about this dashboard or to report data discrepancies.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Purpose and Public Benefit</h3>

                <p>The bylaws of the Parks and Recreation Commission require an annual report to the Board of Directors on "the state of operations, facilities and programs." This dashboard supports that mandate by providing ongoing access to performance data instead of year-end compilation. By making this tool publicly accessible, we foster transparency, enable informed public participation in commission meetings, and demonstrate how data-driven oversight can enhance municipal services.</p>

                <p>Transparency in government operations serves the public interest. Residents deserve to understand their parks system’s performance, resource allocation, and departmental challenges. This dashboard embodies that spirit of open governance.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Acknowledgments</h3>

                <p>This project builds on the 2001 Little Rock Parks and Recreation Master Plan and ongoing efforts by department staff to improve reporting and accountability. We thank the division directors who prepare monthly reports for this analysis and the commissioners who ensure Little Rock's parks serve all residents well.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Legal Basis for Commission Oversight</h3>

                <p>The Little Rock Parks and Recreation Commission operates under the Little Rock Board of Directors. Among the commission's responsibilities are consulting with the Parks Director on budget needs, recommending capital funding allocations, advising on master plan implementation, and reporting annually to the Board. This dashboard serves to enhance those duties effectively.</p>
